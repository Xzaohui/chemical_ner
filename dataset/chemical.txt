Abstract
Magnesium (Mg) is the lightest structural metal. However, the poor formability of Mg alloys to
great extent limits their applications in making structural parts. Formability is strongly correlated
to both high tensile elongation and large work hardening capacity. Here, we report a new
Mg−Al−Ca alloy in which a majority of deformable Al2Ca precipitates form while the formation
of Laves phases of Mg17Al12 and Mg2Ca seems suppressed. Al2Ca precipitates imped dislocation
motion, leading to large work hardening. Then, Al2Ca precipitates deform with dislocations and
stacking faults under the enhanced flow stress, which relieve local stress concentration and
improve tensile elongation. In addition, solutes Al and Ca suppress twin nucleation while
promoting <c+a> dislocations in Mg. This new Mg−Al−Ca alloy demonstrates one of the highest
combinations of tensile elongation and work hardening capacity among existing Mg alloys.

1. Introduction
Magnesium (Mg) is the lightest structural metal. Commercial Mg alloys such as AZ31
possesses higher specific strength than most aluminum alloys and steels [1]. Nonetheless, poor
formability of Mg at room temperature limits the widespread applications of this metal [2]. Metal
formability is generally correlated to tensile elongation and work hardening. Elongation measures
the strain limit for a material to sustain uniaxial tension, while work hardening represents the
material’s resistance to necking [3]. Elongation of commercial Mg alloys (e.g., AZ31) is typically
10%−15% along the extrusion or rolling directions [4,5]. While the elongation of Mg can be
improved by grain refinement [6–9], such efforts often reduce the work hardening.
Addition of rare earth (RE) elements such as Y, Ce, Gd, and Nd can enhance Mg’s formability
by both weakening the texture and activating non-basal slip [10–18]. When these alloys undergo
proper heat treatment, fine Mg-RE precipitates can form on prismatic planes, which effectively
inhibit basal dislocations and enhance strength as well [19]. WE series alloys (Mg–Y–Nd) with a
combination of high strength and ductility are often used in aerospace applications [20]. Despite
the advantages of Mg–RE alloys, the limited availability of rare earth makes it too expensive for
general industries. Hence, RE-free Mg alloys are being searched continuously.
Ca, as a useful alloying element, has received more and more attention [21–23]. Recently, it
has been found that a dilute co-addition of Al and Ca can enhance the elongation as well as the
yield strength (YS) of Mg [24–26]. For example, a Mg–1.0Al–0.1Ca (wt.%) rolled alloy shows
elongation of ~20% [24], which was attributed to the enhanced <c+a> activity. A
Mg−0.6Al−0.28Ca−0.25Mn (wt%) extruded alloy exhibits YS of 253 MPa at the peak-aged T6
condition because of the formation of Al−Ca-rich Guinier-Preston (G.P.) zones, which provides
resistance against dislocation motion [26]. In all those studies, Al and Ca were kept below their
2

solubility limits to prevent the formation of Laves phases of Mg17Al12 (A12, cubic structure) and
Mg2Ca (C14, hexagonal structure), which are generally detrimental for the material’s ductility.
Herein, we report the development of a new Mg–6Al–1Ca (wt%) alloy that possesses both
high elongation and strong work hardening. By carefully controlling the alloy chemistry and
processing procedures, the formation of Mg17Al12 and Mg2Ca were avoided. Instead, precipitation
of Al2Ca was found in its microstructure. Those Al2Ca precipitates are nonshearable but
deformable. As a result, this Mg−Al−Ca alloy demonstrates one of the highest combinations of
tensile elongation and work hardening capacity among existing Mg alloys. With its simple
composition, this new Mg alloy will be very attractive for industrial applications.

2. Experimental procedures
Commercial-purity Mg (99.95%), Al (99.95%), and a Mg–20 wt% Ca master alloy were used
to prepare the Mg–6Al–1Ca (wt%) alloy. The raw materials were melted in an electric resistance
furnace at 750 °C under a protective atmosphere of CO2 (99 vol.%) and SF6 (1 vol.%) gas mixture.
After refining, the melted liquid was cooled to 730 °C and then cast into an ingot (20 mm × 100
mm × 150 mm). The ingot was solution treated at 450 °C for 24 h, followed by extrusion at 250 °C
with extrusion ratio = 18:1 and extrusion speed = 2 mm s-1. Calculation of phase fractions was
performed using the Thermo-CalcTM 2020a software in conjunction with the database TCMG5
(version 5.1). The calculation range is 0 to 700°C, with an interval of 1°C.
In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiment was performed at the beamline 1–ID of the
Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory. The X-ray energy was 71.68
keV (wavelength λ = 0.1730 Å), and the size of the beam was 150 μm × 150 μm. Fig. 1 shows the
schematic of the in situ experiment, four area detectors (GE1, GE2, GE3, and GE4) were placed
3

approximately 2.6 m away from the specimen to collect the diffraction data. Detector geometric
parameters such as the detector distance, detector tilt angles, and the beam center were calibrated
using a CeO2 standard sample by checking the radii and the eccentricity of the diffraction rings. A
flat dog-bone shaped tensile specimen with a gauge length of 5 mm and a cross-section of 1.0 ×
1.0 mm2 had been extracted from the Mg–6Al–1Ca extruded bar, with the tensile axis being
parallel to the extrusion direction. During the tensile test, the crosshead speed on the specimen was
constant at 0.03 mm min-1, equivalent to a nominal strain rate of 1.0 × 10-4 s-1. The detectors
recorded the diffraction patterns every 25 seconds during the tensile test. Diffraction patterns from
the GE3 detector were used to analyze the lattice strain and full width at half maximum (FWHM)
of different peaks.

Figure 1. A schematic of the in situ tensile test with synchrotron X-ray diffraction.

The two-dimensional diffraction rings were integrated along the azimuthal directions to onedimensional diffraction profiles. Each diffraction peak was fitted by a Gaussian function to extract
its peak position and FWHM. The d-spacing of the corresponding {h k l} plane, dhkl, was calculated
by the Bragg’s law:

where λ=0.1730 Å is the X-ray wavelength and θhkl is the diffraction angle. Lattice strain,

is

calculated as:

where

and

strain, respectively.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to characterize the Al2Ca
precipitates and the surrounding dislocation configuration microstructure using a JEOL JEM–
2100F instrument. TEM samples were twin-jet electropolished in a solution of ethanol – 4%
perchloric acid electrolyte at 30 V and −40 °C, followed by ion milling. Burgers vectors of the
observed dislocations were analyzed by the invisibility criterion g⋅b = 0. <a> type dislocations are
visible under the g = (1010) condition but invisible under the g = (0002) condition; <c+a> type
dislocations are visible under both the g = (1010) and g = (0002) conditions. Using the TEM
samples, transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD) was performed using a GAIA3 instrument
(Tescan, Czech Republic).
Slip trace analysis was also performed to statistically examine the slip activity in the Mg phase.
A flat dog-bone shaped tensile specimen with a gauge dimension of 11 mm (length) ×4.0 mm
(width) × 1.4 mm (thickness) was mounted in a MICROTEST 200N (Deben, UK) module placed
in a Zeiss Gemini scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an electron backscatter diffraction
(EBSD) system (Oxford Instrument, UK). The tension direction was also parallel to the extrusion
direction. The top surface of the specimen had been mechanically ground and electro-polished in
ethanol – 10% perchloric acid electrolyte at 30 V for 150 s at −30 °C for EBSD characterization.
5

After the initial EBSD scan, the specimen was loaded at a crosshead speed of 0.1 mm min−1,
equivalent to the nominal strain rate of 1.5 × 10−4 s−1. The test was paused at different strains for
secondary electron imaging and more EBSD scans of the same surface region. Slip trace analysis
was performed for the observed slip lines. A set of parallel slip lines in a given grain is associated
with dislocation glide on a particular slip plane. These slip lines should be parallel to the
intersection line between the slip plane and the sample surface. Based on the grain orientation
measured by EBSD, we computed the directions of all possible slip planes in the sample coordinate
system and drew their intersections with the surface plane. Comparing the computational result
with the observed slip lines allowed us to infer the activated slip system. More details of slip trace
analysis can be found in [27].

3. Results
3.1 Mg−Al−Ca alloy development and microstructure characterization
A Mg–6Al–1Ca (wt%) alloy (AX61) was obtained by the above homogenization-extrusion
procedure. Fig. 2(a) shows our thermodynamics calculation of the phase fractions as a function of
temperature for this composition using the Thermo-CalcTM software. After casting, the alloy was
homogenized at 450 °C for 24h and then extruded at 250 °C, as demonstrated in Fig. 2(b). The
chosen thermomechanical path prevented the formation of eutectic A12 Mg17Al12 and C36 (Mg,
Al)2Ca (dihexagonal structure) [26]. Instead, C15 Al2Ca (cubic structure) was the only type of
precipitate found in the material, as revealed by synchrotron X-ray diffraction (Fig. 3(a, b)).

Fig. 3(a) shows the initial diffraction pattern of the AX61 tensile specimen from the GE3
detector. After integrating the diffraction pattern along the azimuthal direction (Fig. 3(b)), all
diffraction peaks were identified either from Mg or Al2Ca. From the diffraction profile, the volume
fraction of Al2Ca is estimated to be 4.2% using the MAUD software [28]. Transmission Kikuchi
diffraction (TKD) was further taken to analyze a total of 29 Al2Ca precipitates from 15 Mg grains.
Unlike many other precipitates with a definite orientation relationship (OR) with respect to the
surrounding Mg, those Al2Ca are nearly random-oriented (Fig. 3(c)). The Al2Ca precipitates are
equiaxed with an average diameter of 0.63 µm (Fig. 3(d)). The Mg phase exhibits a fully
recrystallized microstructure with an average grain size of ~19 μm, as shown by the EBSD scan
result in Fig. 3(e). The associated {0002} pole figure (Fig. 3(f)) indicates that the alloy has a
moderate extrusion fiber texture (m.r.d. = 4.8). Due to the relatively large step size (1 μm) for this
EBSD scan, no Al2Ca phase was indexed.

3.2 Tensile properties of the AX61 alloy
Fig. 4(a) shows the stress-strain curve of the AX61 alloy from the in situ tensile test at
beamline 1-ID of APS. The experimental setup is illustrated in Fig. 1. While the specimen displays
a moderate yield strength (YS) of 125 MPa, it shows tensile elongation of 27% and ultimate tensile
strength (UTS) of 260 MPa. The difference between UTS and YS can be taken as a measure of
work hardening capacity. Fig. 4(b) and Table 1 compare the tensile elongation and the UTS-YS
values of different Mg wrought alloys. The AX61 alloy is located at the upper-right corner,
indicating it has better formability than almost all other alloys. The only comparable alloy is
Mg−1Mn−1Nd (wt%, MN11). The MN11 alloy has a slightly smaller grain size (~15 µm) than
AX61 (~19 µm), but its strength (YS=105 MPa, UTS=240 MPa) is lower than AX61 (YS=125
MPa, UTS=260 MPa). Besides, the MN11 alloy contains an expensive rare earth element of Nd.
Therefore, the AX61 alloy is overall superior to MN11.

3.3 Deformation mechanisms in AX61
Debye rings of the Mg 1120 peak around the tensile direction at the strains of 0% and 25%
are shown in Fig. 5(a). The discrete diffraction spots at 0% strain became connected due to the
accumulated dislocations after 25% strain. The Debye rings were integrated into one-dimensional
profiles over a range of ±5° around the tensile direction, which is called the axial diffraction profile.
Fig. 5(b) shows the Mg 1120 peak from the axial diffraction profile. The peak position shifted
towards smaller 2-θ values, indicating an increase of the d-spacing of the Mg 1120 plane.
Lattice strains associated with the Mg 1120 peak and other peaks can be computed from
the peak shifting using Eq. (2). Fig. 5(c, d) show the evolution of lattice strains of different Mg
and Al2Ca peaks as a function of the macroscopic strain. For the Mg phase, its 1011 , 1012 ,
1013 peaks exhibited lower lattice strains than 1010 and 1120 , indicating that basal slip is
easier than prismatic slip to be activated in this material [42]. For the Al2Ca phase, lattice strains
of its {222}, {422}, {511}, and {440} peaks are slightly higher than the Mg 1010 and 1120
peaks. The Young’s modulus of Al2Ca is approximately 103 GPa [45], which is more than twice
that of Mg (45 GPa). Therefore, the Al2Ca phase bears more stress than the Mg phase. To further
analyze the stress partitioning between Mg and Al2Ca, lattice strains of different peaks in both
phases were plotted as a function of the applied stress in Fig. 5(e, f). In the elastic deformation
stage, lattice strains in both phases increased linearly with the applied stress. At about 125 MPa,
lattice strains of Mg 1011 and 1012 peaks decreased while lattice strains of all Al2Ca peaks
increased substantially, indicating load transfer from the Mg matrix to Al2Ca precipitates.
Deformation also broadened the peaks (see Fig. 5(b)). To quantify peak broadening, the
patterns should not be integrated over a large azimuthal range of 90°, as the deviation in lattice
strain along different sample directions will cause artifacts in the computed FWHM [46−48].
11

Instead, the two-dimensional diffraction pattern was caked into 10° azimuthal slices from the axial
direction (0°) to the transverse direction (90°). Each slice was then integrated into individual 1D
profiles. Those profiles were fit with Gaussian functions to obtain the FWHM and integrated
intensity of each peak of interest. The FWHM results were averaged over all measured azimuthal
slices using integrated intensity weighting. Fig. 5(g) shows that the FWHMs of Mg peaks increased
moderately with strain as the result of dislocation accumulation. In contrast, FWHMs of Al2Ca
peaks increased much more rapidly with strain (Fig. 5(h)), indicating ultrahigh microstrains in
Al2Ca precipitates. Similar behaviors were previously observed in an age-hardened
Mg−2.2wt%Nd alloy with abundant Mg3Nd precipitates [49]. In that alloy, the Mg3Nd precipitates
can be sheared by basal dislocations, which causes the large internal microstrain.

Deformation in the Mg phase was further studied by surface slip trace analysis. Fig. 6(a, b)
shows the IPF map and corresponding SEM image of a small area from the specimen used in the
in situ SEM/EBSD test after 4% strain. Deformation twins are rarely observed, so almost all grains
were deformed by slip. From the slip trace analysis, basal slip is the dominant deformation mode,
while prismatic, pyramidal I, and pyramidal II slip lines were also occasionally found. Slip trace
analysis was then performed in a larger area with 176 grains. At 4% strain, about 80% of the
observed slip traces belong to basal slip. Most non-basal slip traces initiated from grain boundaries
(Fig. 7). Notably, pyramidal II slip traces, which are associated with <c+a> dislocations were
observed in AX61 at this early deformation stage. In contrast, our previous study of as-extruded
Mg−0.47wt%Ca and AZ31 alloys showed no pyramidal II slip tracess at 4% strain [27]. Those
<c+a> dislocations are critical for the high formability of the AX61 alloy.

TEM analysis was performed to characterize the deformation of Al2Ca precipitates. Unlike
Mg3Nd, we did not observe any Al2Ca precipitate being sheared by dislocations. Instead,
dislocations and {111} stacking faults were observed in many Al2Ca precipitates after only 2%
and 4% strain, as shown in Fig. 8(a, b). Those dislocations and stacking faults developed inside
Al2Ca precipitates would induce heterogeneous microstrain and cause diffraction peak broadening
(see Fig. 5(h)), especially for the {222} peak.
Since Al2Ca precipitates do not hold a certain orientation relation with the Mg matrix, slip
transmission for dislocations from matrix into precipitates would be difficult. It is expected that
the so-called geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) would form around those Al2Ca
precipitates [50]. This hypothesis was actually confirmed by TEM observations. An example is
16

shown in Fig. 9. Dislocations visible at the g = (1010) condition are <a> dislocations on the basal
plane, while dislocations visible at the g = (0002) condition are <c+a> dislocations. Three <c+a>
dislocations apparently nucleated from the lower-left Al2Ca precipitate into the adjacent Mg matrix.
Those <c+a> dislocations likely formed to accommodate stress concentration near the Mg/Al2Ca
interface.

4. Discussion
Here, we compare the tensile properties of the AX61 alloy (YS=125 MPa, UTS=260 MPa,
elongation=27%) with a conventional AZ31 alloy [51] (YS=173 MPa, UTS=238 MPa,
elongation=12%). The two extruded alloys are similar in grain size (19 µm vs 21 µm) and texture
strength (4.8 m.r.d vs 3.8 m.r.d), so the difference in their tensile properties must be attributed to
the deformation mechanisms. YS of AX61 is lower than that of AZ31 by about 48 MPa. From Fig.
6(c), basal slip dominates the early deformation stages in both AX61 and AZ31. Therefore, the YS
of AX61 being lower must be attributed to the softening of basal slip, which is likely caused by
solute Ca. Cihova et al. [26] showed that in a peak-aged Mg−0.6Al−0.28Ca−0.25Mn (wt%)
extruded alloy, YS can be as high as 236 MPa. In that alloy, ordered monolayer G.P. zones with
Al:Ca=2 and average plate diameter of 3.6 nm were formed on the basal plane. The G.P. zones
had a high number density to effectively block basal dislocations; it was estimated that the G.P.
zones increase the YS by 66 MPa. In the present AX61 alloy, the Al2Ca precipitates have an
average diameter of 0.63 µm, which is two orders of magnitude larger than the G.P. zones. Thus,
the initial strengthening effect of Al2Ca should be very limited.
After yielding, however, the AX61 alloy displayed strong work hardening and high elongation.
Work hardening generally arises from the increase of dislocation density, ρ. According to the
Kocks-Mecking theory [52], the dislocation density evolution in the plastic deformation stage can
be described by the following equation:
18

"#
"$%

(3)

= & #' − & # + &*

where $+ is the plastic strain, & , & and &* are constants. On the right hand side of Eq. (3), the
first term represents the statistical storage of dislocations. The second term is the dynamic recovery
term, which depends on strain rate and solute concentration. The third term is related to the
geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) formed around nonshearable precipitates [53]. Since
Al2Ca is nonshearable, the <c+a> dislocations in Fig. 9 are essentially GNDs. Nucleation of GNDs
around Al2Ca increases the total dislocation density and cause the strong work hardening in the
AX61 alloy. On the other hand, because Al2Ca precipitates are internally deformable, stress
concentration at the Mg/Al2Ca interface can be quickly relieved, so the material can maintain high
ductility.
The plastic deformation of Al2Ca is also worth discussion. Al2Ca has the C15 cubic structure.
The atomistic coordinates of Al and Ca are 8a (0.125, 0.125, 0.125) and 16d (0.50, 0.50, 0.50),
respectively, making the C15 structure similar to the FCC structure. The lattice constant of Al2Ca
is 0.801 nm [54]. The Burgers vector length of the {111}<110> slip system is about 0.57 nm in
Al2Ca, which is comparable to the Burgers vector length of <c+a> dislocations (~0.61 nm) in Mg.
High tensile elongation is usually achieved in those Mg alloys with rare earth solutes
[8,10,11,13,15,16]. Rare earth solutes can randomize the extrusion/rolling texture, suppress twin
nucleation, and make non-basal slip more active, all of which are beneficial for material ductility.
From Fig. 6(d), this AX61 alloy displays a moderate extrusion texture. In situ EBSD was
conducted for the AX61 alloy at 0, 1%, 2%, 4%, 8%, and 16% strains (Fig. 10). Twin volume
fractions at different strains were measured and summarized in Fig. 11. After 16% strain, only 1.5%
of the volume became twins. For comparison, the Mg−0.47Ca alloy previously studied in [27]
developed more twins. Therefore, deformation twining is suppressed in AX61.
19

Finally, pyramidal <c+a> slip lines were found in this AX61 alloy (Fig. 6(c)). In pure Mg,
<c+a> dislocations are difficult to glide because of the pyramidal-to-basal transition [55]. Rare
earth solutes, such as Y, can make <c+a> dislocations glissile by accelerating cross-slip of <c+a>
dislocations between pyramidal I and II planes [15]. Through first-principles computations,
Ahmad et al. [56] recently found that 2 at% Al and 0.06 at% Ca solutes together can potentially
promote the above cross-slip of <c+a> dislocations. That theory can account for the enhanced
<c+a> slip in this AX61 alloy. By accommodating c-axis plastic deformation and alleviate stress
concentration at grain boundaries, the activation of <c+a> slip often improves the tensile
elongation of Mg [13,24]. Using micromechanical tests, Liu et al. [57,58] demonstrated that the
glide of <c+a> dislocations significantly increases the flow stress in Mg during deformation, which
may be another reason for the large work hardening in the AX61 alloy.

A few experimental studies using atom probe tomography (APT) [21,59] and High-angle
annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) [60] show that Ca,
like some rare earth elements, tend to segregate at grain boundaries and twin boundaries. Firstprinciple calculations also suggest that Ca has one of the largest grain boundary/twin boundary
segregation energy [61]. Somekawa et al. [62] recently observed that non-basal dislocations often
nucleate from grain boundaries in Mg−Y and Mg−Ca, and they proposed that the grain boundary
segregation of Y and Ca can activate non-basal dislocations. In the present AX61 alloy, grain
boundaries are the primary nucleation sites of non-basal slip. In fact, 75% of the prismatic slip
traces, 85% of the pyramidal I slip traces, and 100% of the pyramidal II slip traces initiated from
grain boundaries. Those non-basal slip may be caused by grain boundary segregation of Ca.
A schematic of the deformation mechanisms in AX61 is shown in Fig. 12. Upon yielding,
basal slip was first activated in Mg. Dislocation pile-up at the Al2Ca/Mg interfaces generates
GNDs. Al2Ca deformed subsequently by dislocation slip or stacking faults on the {111} plane.
22

Non-basal dislocations are generated from grain boundaries due to the segregation of Ca. The
nonshearable but deformable Al2Ca, along with the enhanced <c+a> dislocation activity are
responsible for the large work hardening and high tensile elongation of this material.

5. Conclusions
In this work, we designed an extruded Mg–6Al–1Ca (wt%) alloy, AX61. This alloy displays
one of the highest combinations of tensile elongation (~27%) and work hardening (UTS – YS =
135 MPa). In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy were employed to study
the deformation of this alloy. The main conclusions are summarized as follows:
(1) The AX61 alloy shows a moderate extrusion texture and a fully recrystallized microstructure
with a mean grain size of ~19 μm. The alloy contains Al2Ca precipitates with a volume fraction of
~4.2% and average diameter of 0.63 μm.
(2) During deformation, basal slip is the main deformation mode while twining is suppressed in
the Mg phase. Non-basal slips, especially pyramidal II <c+a> slip can be activated from grain
23

boundaries at the early deformation stage. The activation of non-basal slip systems, which is
attributed to solute Al and Ca, enhances the ductility of this alloy.
(3) The Al2Ca precipitates are nonshearable by dislocations in Mg, but they can deform plastically
by forming internal dislocations and stacking faults. Stress concentration at the Mg/Al2Ca interface
can be quickly relieved by the internal plasticity of Al2Ca, so the material can maintain high
ductility.
(4) Nucleation of geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) around Al2Ca increases the total
dislocation density, and it leads to the strong work hardening of this alloy.

difficult-to-process materials into components with geometric complexity and high mechanical

performance. In this work, a near-α titanium alloy Ti-6Al-2Zr-1Mo-1V (TA15) designed for service

14

temperatures of ~500 ℃ in the aerospace industry was processed by HIP at three representative

15

temperatures. A systematic study on the phase constitutions, microstructural evolution, and tensile

16

properties measured at 20, 500, 600, and 700 ℃ was carried out for the assessment of HIP TA15

17

specimens. The relationships among HIP temperature, crystallographic characteristic, and

18

mechanical performance of HIP TA15 were elucidated in detail. Spark plasma sintering (SPS) was

19

selected to compare with the HIP technique regarding the fabrication of TA15 alloy. The tensile

strength and ductility of the HIP specimens at 500 ℃ were 14.8% and 52.8% higher than those of

21

the SPS counterparts. Furthermore, the high-temperature tensile properties of HIP TA15 specimens

22

were comparable to those of the forged IMI 685 and even better than those of sintered Ti60 parts.

These findings can serve as a guideline for the HIP process of TA15 alloy and the HIP parameter

optimization for other near-α Ti alloys applied in harsh environments.

1. Introduction
The manufacturing level in aerospace is an essential symbol of comprehensive national power

31

and international competitiveness. Developed countries uninterruptedly devote to the exploration

32

and development of novel and advanced high-strength materials for the next-generation aircraft

33

with higher mechanical performance and longer service life [1]. A series of advanced metal

34

materials have been developed to acclimatize harsher service environments during the past decades.

35

Taking Ti alloys for examples, British IMI series (e.g., IMI 550 [2], IMI 834 [3]), Russian BT series

36

(e.g., BT9 [4], BT25 [5]), American brands (e.g., Ti811 [6], Ti1100 [7]), and Chinese brands (e.g.,

37

Ti55 [8], Ti60 [9]) have been developed for Ti alloy components applied in aerospace engineering

38

to withstand high-temperature service environments. Additionally, to make the structures

39

lightweight, the high-performance critical components with complex structures in aircraft have to

40

be manufactured integrally [10]. The complex geometrical shapes and difficult-to-process materials

41

pose the challenge of the integral manufacture of the critical components in the aerospace industry.

42

Currently, casting and machining processes are the two most common integral manufacturing

43

methods for these components in the aerospace industry. Unfortunately, the casting process can

44

realize the complex components fabricated integrally, but the accompanied coarse microstructure,

45

composition segregation, and porosity in the casted components lead to the relatively weak

46

mechanical properties. These limitations make the casting process undesirable for the

47

high-performance development demand of the next-generation aircraft. Machining is severely

48

restricted by the disadvantages of low material utilization, productivity efficiency, and high

49

manufacturing cost. Bowden et al. reported that approximately 83% of raw titanium alloy was

50

wasted in the form of machining chips during the machining of the airframe of Boeing 787 [11].

Hot isostatic pressing (HIP), as a promising advanced powder metallurgy (PM) technique, is

52

able to rapidly fabricate nearly full dense and complex components with fine microstructure and

53

excellent mechanical properties directly from loose metal powders under the assistance of computer
2

modeling to predict the shrinkage of capsules during the HIP process. Tremendous economy and

55

industrial production advantages endow the HIP technique with a promising prospect in the

56

aerospace industry for the manufacture of complex geometry components with desirable

57

mechanical properties. A Ti alloy cryogenic impeller in the liquid hydrogen turbo-pump [12] and a

58

Ni-superalloy turbine disc in aero-engines [13] were fabricated via this technique. Both components

59

displayed excellent mechanical properties that were equivalent to their forged counterparts. More

60

recently, HIP has been widely utilized to process newly-developed materials in the aerospace sector.

61

For instance, Habel et al. employed HIP to process TiAl alloy Ti4522XD and optimize the HIP

62

parameters based on the tensile properties at room temperature [14]. Guo et al. revealed the effect

63

of powder surface chemical state on the microstructure and room-temperature tensile properties of

64

near-α Ti alloy Ti55 manufactured by HIP [15]. A two-step HIP process was designed for

65

Ti-47Al-2Cr-2Nb TiAl alloy to tune mechanical properties at ambient temperature by adjusting the

66

content of the B2 phase [16]. An asynchronous loading HIP strategy proposed by our group could

67

in-situ avoid the carbide precipitation along prior particle boundaries for nickel superalloy

68

FGH4097 [17]. The room-temperature tensile strength and ductility of specimens enhanced

69

simultaneously compared with those of counterparts manufactured by the traditional synchronous

70

HIP procedure. To date, extensive fundamental research has been explored for the HIP fabrication

71

of difficult-to-process and advanced metals to obtain attractive mechanical properties at room

72

temperature. However, most of these newly-developed alloys are designed for a specific

73

high-temperature service range. Evaluation of the mechanical performance of these alloys at the

74

specific service temperatures is of importance to guide their industrial applications.

Ti-6Al-2Zr-1Mo-1V (refers to TA15), a type of near-α titanium alloy, serves at 500 ℃ and is

76

utilized to produce large-scale components with irregular geometries (bulkhead and nacelle center

77

beam frame) in aerospace [18]. In this work, a systematic investigation on the phase constitution

78

and microstructure evolution of HIP TA15 specimens produced at three representative HIP
3

79

temperatures was carried out. The mechanical properties of all HIP TA15 specimens at room

80

temperature and around its specific service temperatures (500, 600, and 700 ℃) are studied. The

81

application feasibility of the HIP technique on the manufacture of this near-α Ti alloy was

82

comprehensively evaluated by comparison of spark-plasma-sintered TA15 parts and other types of

83

wrought near-α Ti alloys.

2. Experimental procedures

2.1. Powder material

of

85

A gas-atomized TA15 powder was provided by AMC Powders Company (China). The

88

as-received TA15 powder particles presented near-spherical shapes with a Gaussian distribution in

89

the diameter range of 20‒80 µm centered on 35.6 μm (Fig. 1(a‒c)).

re

-p

ro

87

To select a rational experimental HIP temperature range, a differential scanning calorimetry

91

(DSC) measurement was conducted under a heating rate of 20 °C/min to detect the β transition (βtr)

92

temperature of this alloy. The βtr temperature was determined to be 953.6°C at the strongest

93

exothermal peak in the DCS curve (Fig. 1(a‒c)) due to the exothermic transformation of hexagonal

94

close-packed (HCP) α-Ti phase to body-centered cubic (BCC) β-Ti phase. Cao et al. pointed out

95

that high pressures could reduce the βtr temperature of Ti alloys by 0.08 ℃/MPa in HIP [19]. By

96

combining these two aspects, it was suggested that the βtr temperature of this alloy was

97

approximately 945 ℃ under high pressure of 120 MPa.

2.2. HIP process

100

SAE 1045 steel capsules with an internal diameter of 60 mm, a length of 150 mm, and a wall

101

thickness of 2 mm were manufactured by machining. The TA15 alloy powder particles were filled

102

into these capsules and degassed at 600°C to remove air, and then the stem on the top of the

103

capsules was welded as the vacuum level of the capsules reached 1×10-3 Pa. Finally, the sealed
4

104

capsules were put into a QIH-15 HIP machine (ABB Company, USA). The details regarding

105

powder filling, vacuuming, and sealing, were described in our previous research [20].

106

The capsules were heated to 930 °C, 980 °C and 1030 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C/min and

107

pressurized up to 120 MPa for 3 h, followed by cooling at 5 °C/min to room temperature. Three

108

representative temperatures 930 °C, 980 °C, and 1030°C were below, close to, and above the βtr

109

temperature of TA15, respectively. The applied HIP temperatures 930 °C, 980 °C, and 1030°C were

110

denoted as HIP-A, HIP-B, and HIP-C, respectively, in the following study.

2.3. Spark plasma sintering (SPS) process

A graphite mold with an internal diameter of 50 mm was filled with 88.5 g TA15 powder and

114

then put into a LABOX-1575 SPS device (SINTER LAND Inc, Japan). The mold was heated to

115

1000 °C for 10 min under a uniaxial load of 10 MPa in a vacuum atmosphere, and then the pressure

116

was gradually increased to 40 MPa in 3 min when the temperature reached 1000 °C. After holding

117

the temperature and pressure for 10 min, the pressure was reduced to 10 MPa again in 15 s, and the

118

sintered specimen was cooled to 100 °C in the SPS furnace finally.

2.3. Microstructural characterization and mechanical testing

121

The HIP specimens were examined by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD) (XRD-7000S, Japan)

122

with a Cu anticathode (λ=1.5406 Å) at 35 kV and 40 mA for phase identification. A scan at 5o/min

123

was conducted over a wide range of 30–80o to give a general overview of their diffraction peaks.

124

TEM examinations together with EDX analyses (Tecnai G2 F30, FEI, Holland) at a voltage of 300

125

kV was conducted to confirm the phase constitution further.

126

Metallographic specimens were cut, ground, and polished according to standard procedures

127

and etched with a Kroll reagent (2% HF, 6% HNO3, and 92% H2O) for 15–20s before

128

microstructural observations using field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, Quanta650
5

129

FEG, USA) and electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA, EPMA-8050G, Japan). The texture and

130

crystallographic orientations of the HIP specimens were examined by electron backscattered

131

diffraction (EBSD). EBSD testing was performed on an HKL Nordlys orientation imaging

132

microscope system (Oxford, Oxford Instruments, Unite Kingdom) with a step size of 0.5 μm, and

133

the EBSD data was processed by HKL Channel 5 software package. Before EBSD, the specimens

134

were mechanically polished and then electrolytically polished by a corrosive solution with 8%

135

perchloric acid and 92% ethanol at 27 V for 25 s.
The tensile tests at 20, 500, 600, and 700 ℃ were performed with a crosshead speed of 1

137

mm/min. The shape and dimension of the specimens at room and high temperatures have been

138

demonstrated in our previous research [21]. The fracture surfaces of the tested specimens were

139

observed using SEM.

3.1. Phase identification

140

The typical XRD patterns of as-received powder particles and specimens processed under

144

various HIP temperatures within a wide 2θ range (30°–80°) was shown in Fig. 2. Overall, the

145

diffraction peaks of the HCP structure of Ti could be identified in all the specimens. Wherein, the

146

HCP-Ti phase in TA15 alloy powder belonged to non-equilibrium α′-Ti due to the rapid melting and

147

solidification of TA15 powder during the gas atomization preparation process. An HCP-Ti phase in

148

the HIP specimens was assigned to the α-Ti phase since the martensitic α′-Ti phase in the

149

as-received powder decomposed entirely into the α-Ti or β-Ti phases once it was heated above

150

800 °C [22].

Jo

ur

143

151

Apart from the α-Ti phase, the strongest diffraction peak of a BCC β-Ti phase (110) at 38.4°

152

was detected in all the HIP specimens. The β-Ti phase originated from the decomposition of the

153

α′-Ti phase during the HIP heating process and the residual β-Ti phase from the transformation of
6

β-Ti to α-Ti during the HIP cooling process. The transformation of β-Ti phase to α′-Ti phase during

155

the TA15 powder preparation process was a non-diffusive transformation due to the transformation

156

of liquid drops to powder particles at high cooling rates (104–106 ℃/s). As a result, supersaturated

157

β-Ti phase stabilizing elements (Zr, Mo, and V) were trapped into the α′-Ti phase in the TA15

158

powder. During the HIP heating process, the α-Ti phase would be nucleated along the α′-Ti

159

boundaries; meanwhile, supersaturated β-Ti phase stabilizing elements were expelled from the α′-Ti

160

or α-Ti phases leading to the formation of the β-Ti phase [23]. Subsequently, the α-Ti phase would

161

transform to the β-Ti phase when the HIP temperature reached the βtr temperature, but a part of the

162

β-Ti phase would retain during the HIP cooling process owing to the segregation of the β-phase

163

stabilizing elements.

To confirm the phase constitution further, the HIP-B specimen was characterized by TEM (Fig.

165

3). There were two distinct regions, i.e., dark grey matrix and stripe-like light grey area in the

166

high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) images. The dark grey matrix was enriched with the α-Ti

167

phase stabilizing element Al (7.45 wt.%) and poor in the β-Ti phase stabilizing element V (1.35

168

wt.%). The light grey area presented inverse element content tendency, as listed in Table 1. These

169

EDS point results suggested that the dark grey matrix and the light grey area were assigned to the

170

α-Ti and β-Ti phases, respectively. The EDS results were also consistent with the high-resolution

171

TEM (HRTEM) and EDS line scan results (Fig. 3(c) and (d)).

3.2. Microstructural evolution
The crystalline structures of all HIP specimens are shown in Fig. 4. A heterogeneous

178

microstructure (i.e., lath-like and equiaxed structures) was observed in the HIP-A specimen. A

179

number of lath-like cluster structures were embedded into near-spherical structures with a similar

180

diameter size of the as-received powder in the HIP-A specimen. The deformation of powder

181

particles could prompt dynamic recrystallization and then generate equiaxed grains around their

182

prior powder particle boundaries (PPBs) [20]. Based on the diameter size of the near-spherical

183

structure and the absence of the equiaxed grain around the near-spherical structure boundaries, it

184

indicated that these near-spherical structures originated from the undeformed as-received TA15

185

powder particles. Guo et al. found an identical inhomogeneous microstructure in near-α titanium

186

alloy Ti55 [15]. The authors pointed out that there was an oxide layer on the surface of the pre-alloy

187

powder, which protected the as-received powder particles from deformation during HIP. For the

188

HIP-B and HIP-C specimens, lamellar structures evenly dispersed, and unbroken PPB structures

189

disappeared completely. This signifies that an increase in HIP temperature could facilitate the

190

softening of powder feedstock and stimulate the severe deformation of powder feedstock.

EPMA inspections were carried out to observe the morphology and distribution of the α-Ti and

192

β-Ti phases in the HIP-A specimen (Fig. 5). The grey and white regions in the original image

193

corresponded to the α-Ti and β-Ti phases, which could be judged from the distribution of the α-Ti

194

phase stabilizing element Al and β-Ti phase stabilizing element V. It was readily seen the β-Ti phase

195

with irregular shapes dispersed at the interface of the α-Ti phase.

The EBSD orientation images provide the grain features of all the HIP specimens in Fig. 6.

197

The HIP-A specimen showed a distinctive duplex microstructure; the coexisting structure of fine

198

equiaxed and elongated lath-like grains was similar to the microstructure in Fig. 4(a) and (b). For

199

the HIP-B and HIP-C specimens, the fine lamellar structures (Fig. 4(c‒f)) disappeared in the EBSD

200

orientation images (Fig. 6 (b) and (c)), suggesting that these lamellar-like clusters embedded into

201

the same grain with an identical crystallographic orientation. From the color code distribution in the

202

EBSD images, it can be concluded that the random crystallographic orientations of the grain are
8

203

inherent characteristics of HIP metallic components, which is independent of HIP temperatures.
The pole figure (PF) images showed that all the HIP specimens had a variety of

205

crystallographic orientation (Fig. 7). The maximum texture index in the three HIP specimens was

206

only 6.938, which confirmed the random crystallographic orientations of HIP TA15 specimens. To

207

quantify the crystallographic orientation characteristics, the orientation distribution function (ODF)

208

image of these three specimens was deduced (Fig. 8). The volume fraction of the strongest

209

orientations located at (90°, 20°, 90°), (90°, 30°, 50°) and (60°, 90°, 100°) in the Euler space was

210

calculated to be 2.7%, 4.8%, and 6.1% for the HIP-A, HIP-B and HIP-C specimens respectively

211

using the JTEX software. A similar low crystallographic texture was also reported in Ti-6Al-4V

212

alloy fabricated by HIP [24]. The filled powder particles experienced isotropic pressure and heat

213

during HIP, which contributed to the HIP specimens without preferential crystallographic

214

orientations.

The statistical grain size distribution results were quantificationally analyzed from these EBSD

216

orientation maps (Fig. 9). As expected, the grain sizes of HIP specimens gradually increased with

217

the rise in HIP temperature. The grain sizes were confined in the range of 5 μm to 15 μm, and the

218

average grain size was about 9.7 μm for the HIP-A specimen. For the HIP-B specimen, more than

219

60% of the grains were beyond 10 μm, and the average grain size was 56.0 μm that was even

220

greater than the size of the as-received powder. The average grain size of the HIP-C specimen was

221

65.7 μm slightly larger than that of the HIP-B specimen.

Jo

ur

na

215

222

The average grain size of the HIP specimen showed an approximately 5-fold increase when the

223

temperature was merely increased by 50 ℃ from 930 ℃ to 980 ℃. In other words, the grain sizes

224

would significantly coarsen when the heating temperature exceeded the βtr temperature. This

225

phenomenon mainly resulted from the great distinction of the atom diffusion coefficient in HCP

226

α-Ti and BCC β-Ti phases. The HCP α-Ti atom diffusion coefficient (10-15 m2/s) is two orders of

227

magnitude lower than that in the BCC β-Ti atoms (10-13 m2/s) at 1000 °C, which caused the
9

228

dramatic grain growth when the HIP temperature was above βtr temperature [20].

229
230

3.3. Mechanical properties
Fig. 10 summarizes the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), yield strength (YS), and elongation at

232

break (εab) of the HIP specimens at room temperature. The HIP-B specimen possessed the strongest

233

YS and UTS than the other two ones even though the average grain size of the HIP-B specimen was

234

about 5 times larger than that of the HIP-A specimen. This opposed Hall-Petch relationship could be

235

correlated with the metallurgical bonding strength between the powder particles. Firstly, a higher

236

HIP temperature promoted powder particles to be softer, which would trigger severe plastic

237

deformation of powder and the occurrence of recrystallization at the interface between two

238

neighboring PPBs to improve their interfacial strength. Secondly, under a higher HIP temperature,

239

element interdiffusion between the neighboring particles could also be intensified, which would

240

enhance the metallurgical bonding further. The undeformed particles in the HIP-A specimen (Fig. 4)

241

implied the weak metallurgical bonding strength between the powder particles, which resulted in its

242

inferior tensile properties when compared to the HIP-B specimen. A large number of interparticle

243

rupture features were observed in the fracture surface of the HIP-A specimen, but typical

244

transgranular fracture characteristics were found in the fracture surface of the HIP-B specimen (Fig.

245

11), confirming the above inferences.

The excessive heating temperature utilized in the HIP-C process would coarsen the grain size

247

of the specimens and be detrimental to their tensile strength. The specimens fabricated under the

248

HIP-B process could obtain the optimum tensile properties at room temperature due to the

249

appropriate combination of grain size and metallurgical quality. In addition, the room-temperature

tensile properties of the HIP-B specimens were even comparable to those of the wrought TA15

251

counterparts [25].

A comparison diagram of tensile properties of all the HIP specimens at the temperatures

254

ranging from 500°C to 700°C is shown in Fig. 12. Overall, the UTS variation tendency at these

255

three high temperatures with the increase in HIP temperature was identical to the observation in the

256

room-temperature tensile measurements. The HIP-B specimen demonstrated the highest UTS at

257

each testing temperature. The variation trend in ductility is the same at each testing temperature but

258

was inverse to the variation tendency in strength; the εab decreased initially and then increased with

259

the increase in HIP temperature. The HIP-A specimen with the best ductility was associated with the

260

combination of the lath-like plus equiaxed grain type and finer grain size. Kim et al. pointed out

261

that the ductility of the Ti alloy with equiaxed structures was higher than that of those with a

262

lamellar structure [26]. In general, metallic parts with finer grains means more quantity of grains in

263

a certain volume than the ones with coarser grains. Under the same amount of plastic deformation,

264

for components with finer grains, the deformation amount can be dispersed into more grains, which

265

can alleviate the pile-up of dislocation at the grain boundaries, resulting in more homogeneous

266

deformation in every grain and the plasticity enhancement of the parts.

3.5. Comparison between HIP and SPS manufacture of TA15 specimens

Jo

Spark plasma sintering (SPS) is an advanced PM technique that utilizes pressure-driven

270

powder consolidation in which a pulsed direct electric current passes through a specimen

271

compressed in a graphite mold [27]. HIP and SPS processes, as two promising PM techniques,

272

show the many advantages in terms of the manufacture of components with high density and

273

excellent mechanical properties in contrast with traditional PM techniques, such as hot pressure

274

sintering. The microstructure and high-temperature tensile properties of TA15 prepared by HIP and

275

SPS were compared systematically in the subsequent study.

276

The three-dimensional microstructures of HIP-B and SPS specimens are shown in Fig. 13. A

277

homogeneous microstructure consisting of lamellar structures could be seen throughout both
11

278

specimens. The thickness of the lamellar structure in the SPS specimen was much finer than that in

279

the HIP-B specimen, which originated from the shorter holding time and faster cooling rate during

280

the SPS process.
The EBSD grain orientation and grain size distribution maps of both sintered specimens are

282

shown in Fig. 14. The SPS specimen presented as homogeneous grain orientation as the HIP-B

283

specimen from the color codes distributed in the EBSD images, but the average grain size of the

284

SPS specimen was slightly smaller than that of HIP one. The UTS and εab of the SPS specimens

285

were found to be 959.7 and 564.7 MPa, and 9.5% and 7.2% at 20 and 500 ℃, respectively. It was

286

indicated that the room-temperature tensile properties of SPS specimens were similar to those of the

287

HIP ones, whereas the high-temperature UTS and εab were 14.8% and 52.8% lower than those of the

288

HIP-B ones, respectively. This is mainly because all the HIP specimens had high densification

289

above 99.5%, but the SPS specimens displayed a relative density of 98.6% as measured by

290

Archimides’ principle. Kumar ey al. also reported a consistent density result in regard to the HIP

291

and SPS preparation of TiB/Ti-6Al-4V composites [28]. The rapid sintering process in SPS could

292

not provide sufficient time for the powder particles to sinter together completely in the mode of

293

creep deformation and element diffusion, and the harmful porosity defects in the SPS parts were

294

destructive to their mechanical performance. From the comparison of UTS at room and high

295

temperatures, it was implied that the high-temperature tensile properties were more susceptible to

296

the porosity than room-temperature tensile properties for TA15 components.

In our previous publication, the effect of selective laser melting (SLM) parameters and

298

subsequent heat-treatment for TA15 was studied thoroughly [29]. In contrast with the HIP- and

299

SPS-fabricated TA15 specimens, the SLM-built specimens exhibited much higher tensile strength

300

(~1300 MPa) but with an inferior ductility (~8.0%) at room temperature. The significant differences

301

in the tensile properties of the specimen produced by additive manufacturing and powder

302

metallurgy stemmed from the different phase constitutions and grain sizes. The SLM-built TA15
12

303

specimens main comprised acicular α′ martensite with an average grain size of several micrometers

304

due to the rapid melting and solidification process in SLM. The fine acicular α′ martensite, as a hard

305

and brittle phase, contributed to the superior tensile strength and poor ductility of the SLM-built

306

TA15 specimens [30].

307

Furthermore, tensile properties of the HIP specimens at 20 and 500 ℃ were comparable to

308

those of forged IMI685 with optimum heat treatment, and the tensile properties of the HIP

309

specimens at 600 ℃ were even better than those of hot-pressed-sintered Ti60 parts [31].

The phase and microstructural features, room-temperature and high-temperature (500, 600 and

313

700 ℃) tensile performance of near-α TA15 alloy manufactured under three typical HIP

314

temperatures were investigated thoroughly. The conclusions could be drawn as follows:

lP

re

-p

312

The phase constitutions of all HIP specimens were composed of the dominated α-Ti phase plus

316

the minor β-Ti phase. The β-Ti phase with irregular shape distributed regularly at the interface of

317

the α-Ti phase. The fine microstructure of equiaxed grains plus lath-like would transform to the

318

coarser lamellar microstructure once the HIP temperature excessed the βtr temperature of TA15

319

alloy.

Jo

315

The specimen processed by the HIP-B process showed the highest room-temperature and

321

high-temperature YS and UTS, resulting from the moderate combination of grain sizes and

322

metallurgical quality.

323

The UTS and εab of the HIP-B specimens at 500 ℃ were 14.8% and 52.8% higher than those of

324

the SPS specimens due to the existence of pores, insufficient creep deformation and element

325

diffusion in the SPS specimens.

326

The high-temperature tensile properties of HIP specimens were comparable to those of IMI685

327

forging and even better than those of hot-pressed sintered Ti60 counterpart, suggesting that the HIP
13

328

has a promising further to fabricate near-α titanium with the desirable high-temperature mechanical

329

performance for the aerospace industry.

ABSTRACT: Single-atom alloys (SAAs) play an increasingly signiﬁcant role in the ﬁeld of
single-site catalysis and are typically composed of catalytically active elements atomically
dispersed in more inert and catalytically selective host metals. SAAs have been shown to
catalyze a range of industrially important reactions in electro-, photo-, and thermal catalysis
studies. Due to the unique geometry of SAAs, the location of the transition state and the
binding site of reaction intermediates are often decoupled, which can enable both facile
dissociation of reactants and weak binding of intermediates, two key factors for eﬃcient and
selective catalysis. Often, this results in deviations from transition metal scaling relationships
that limit conventional catalysts. SAAs also oﬀer reduced susceptibility to CO poisoning, cost
savings from reduced precious metal usage, opportunities for bifunctional mechanisms via
spillover, and higher resistance to deactivation by coking that plagues many industrial
catalysts. In this review, we begin by introducing SAAs and describe how model systems and
nanoparticle catalysts can be prepared and characterized. We then review all available SAA
literature on a per reaction basis before concluding with a description of the general
properties of this new class of heterogeneous catalysts and presenting opportunities for future research and development.

Single-atom alloys (SAAs) are a class of single-site catalysts
in which small amounts of isolated metal atoms are present in
the surface layer of a metal host. Typically, they are comprised
of single atoms of a catalytically active metal alloyed into the
surface of a less reactive host metal.13−15 Unlike traditional
catalyst development, in which multiple catalyst samples are
synthesized and tested, SAA catalysts were ﬁrst realized using
surface science and scanning probe studies of model single
crystal samples and this information then transferred to
nanoparticle catalyst synthesis, characterization, and testing
under industrially relevant conditions.14−16 Unlike many
single-site catalysts in the ﬁeld today, the simple and very
well-deﬁned nature of the active sites in SAAs makes
understanding reaction mechanisms relatively easy and enables
a new approach to the rational design of SAA catalysts via
complementary surface science model studies, theory, and real
catalyst synthesis and testing (Figure 1).14,15 To date, most of

1. INTRODUCTION
Catalysts are essential for the production of the vast majority of
chemicals, materials, and fuels essential to the modern
economy.1 Catalysts can be classiﬁed into three categories:
heterogeneous, homogeneous, and enzymatic. Although
enzymatic and homogeneous catalysts oﬀer high selectivity,
due to issues with thermal stability and product-catalyst
separation a great deal of major industrial chemical transformations involve heterogeneous catalysts, which are typically
comprised of transition metals and metal oxides. Unlike
homogeneous and enzymatic catalysts that have extremely
well-deﬁned active sites, heterogeneous catalysts expose a
variety of sites available for reaction. These include, but are not
limited to, the range of nanoparticle geometries found in
catalysts which have diﬀerent metal facets and their associated
defects such as steps, kinks, and reconstructions.2 Considerable
research has been devoted to understanding the relationship
between structure and reactivity in these systems in order to
improve catalytic performance; however, the complexity of
these systems has made their rational design diﬃcult, and they
are still an area of intense research.3
The ﬁeld of single-site catalysis has focused on addressing
these structural complexities by reducing the active site of the
heterogeneous catalyst to a single well-deﬁned and isolated
metal atom typically supported on an oxide.4,5 Some of the ﬁrst
examples of these catalysts come from the FlytzaniStephanopoulos, Gates, and Zhang groups.6−8 For example,
in 2003 work by the Flytzani-Stephanopoulos group
demonstrated that cationic Au on CeO2 was active for the
water−gas shift reaction.6 The term single-atom catalyst was
coined to describe these materials by Zhang and co-workers in
their 2011 paper describing the reactivity of isolated Pt atoms
anchored on FeOx for CO oxidation.8 The last ∼15 years have
seen demonstrations that individual transition metal atoms
anchored on oxide or carbonaceous supports show promise for
many reactions.9−12 While we will not address these types of
single-site catalysts in detail, the interested reader is pointed to
other reviews in this issue that focus on these topics.

the work on these materials has focused on trace amounts of
group 8, 9, and 10 transition metals (Pd, Pt, Rh, Ni, Ru)
alloyed into group 11 metals (Cu, Ag, Au).13−15,17 While
bimetallics, which may or may not contain isolated sites, have
been examined for some time,18−20 it was the work of Sykes
and Flytzani-Stephanopoulos in 2012 that established SAAs as
a class of catalyst and sparked recent interest as shown in
Figure 1.21 SAAs have been shown to catalyze selective
hydrogenations, dehydrogenations, C−C and C−O coupling
reactions, NO reduction, and CO oxidation, among others. As
we will discuss in detail in this review, the SAA approach oﬀers
many unique catalyst properties including improved activity/
selectivity vs the monometallic counterparts, resistance to
deactivation via coke formation, and resistance to CO
poisoning.
We begin this review by describing how to prepare and
characterize SAAs in both model system and nanoparticle form
before reviewing the literature on the chemical reactivity of
SAAs for a wide range of industrially important reactions. We
then comment on the general properties of this new class of
heterogeneous catalyst, the feasibility of industrial scale up, and
potential areas of future research. Since this class of catalyst is
less than a decade old, a great deal of the work on SAAs has

been rather recent and we have attempted to include all SAA
literature published before June 2020. When reviewing the
literature, we used the following deﬁnition of a SAA: a
bimetallic single-site heterogeneous catalyst in which small amounts
of one metal are atomically dispersed in the surface of a dif ferent
metal. We are aware of a variety of intermetallic compounds
such as PdIn which can contain isolated sites, but these
materials generally contain far more dopant atoms and a
broader range of ensemble sizes than most SAAs in which the
doping is only a few percent and the sites are isolated.22−24 As
such, we do not explicitly review intermetallic compounds but
do include comparisons when appropriate.

2.1. Structural StabilityAggregation and Segregation in
Single-Atom Alloys

When considering the stability of a SAA, there are two primary
considerations: the aggregation energy and the segregation
energy. The aggregation energy is a thermodynamic value
based on the relative stability of the isolated dopant atoms vs
dopant clusters, while the segregation energy is based on the
relative stability of the isolated dopant in the surface layer of
the host vs the bulk.34,35 For most SAAs, because the dopant
normally has a higher surface free energy, the segregation
energy is negative; that is, the dopant is more stable in the bulk
than in the surface layer under vacuum conditions.34−36
However, due to the strength of adsorbate−dopant bonds,
adsorbates can keep the dopant at the surface and thus
available for the reaction.34,35 The second important parameter
is the aggregation energy. Two metals with a positive
aggregation energy will show a tendency to form a SAA,
while those with negative aggregation energies will tend to
form clusters of the dopant atom. Although these values serve
as a useful guide, the kinetics of alloy formation can also play a
role in the initial state of alloying, especially for the model
systems. This is useful in terms of being able to place the
dopant atom on, in, and under the surface layer by controlling
alloying temperature and then testing the reactivity of the
diﬀerent sites. While this approach is well established
experimentally, systematic theoretical studies concerning the
kinetics of SAA formation have remained limited.37 Generally,
the kinetics of SAA interdiﬀusion are less of a concern for
nanoparticle catalysts, which will typically reach a steady state

2. EXPERIMENTAL PREPARATION AND
CHARACTERIZATION OF SINGLE-ATOM ALLOYS
SAAs are a type of single-site catalyst generally comprised of
reactive dopants atomically isolated in a less reactive metal
host.13−15 The strong host−dopant interactions that lead to
mixing are responsible for the thermal stability of SAAs in
terms of keeping the dopant sites isolated. This thermodynamic driving force for site isolation is crucial in preventing the
clustering/sintering that plagues many single-atom catalysts.25
As seen in Figure 2, there have been many reports of SAAs,
including PdCu, PtCu, RhCu, NiCu, PdAu, NiAu,, and PtAg
among others.26−32 For the purposes of this review, when
naming a SAA we place the dopant element ﬁrst, then the host
metal although other conventions have been used in the
literature. For example, isolated Pt atom sites in a Cu host
would be referred to as a PtCu SAA. Many of these systems
(such as NiCu) have been prepared as model ultrahigh vacuum
(UHV) catalysts as well as in nanoparticle or nanoporous
catalyst form.27,33 While many SAA combinations have been
demonstrated in model and nanoparticle catalyst experiments,
there are likely many more combinations that have not been
synthesized or tested. Here, theory is a useful guide as to which

(100) planes.35,38 In agreement with their work on the (111)
surface, they ﬁnd that in a vacuum environment most dopants
show a preference for bulk segregation that can be reversed by
CO. Additionally, although there are some slight diﬀerences
between aggregation in the (111), (100), and (211) surfaces,
the largest diﬀerences they discovered related to CO binding
energies. Interestingly, the binding energies of CO on isolated
dopant sites in the (111) and (100) surfaces are fairly similar
despite the diﬀerence in host coordination numbers, while CO
binding to undercoordinated isolated sites at the (211) step
edge is stronger. Theory based expressions which predict CO
binding strength as a function of dopant−dopant coordination
number have also been discussed by Zhao and co-workers.40 In
another theoretical study, Fu and Luo presented calculations
for many other dopant atoms (Fe, Ru, Os, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd,
and Pt), with just Cu as the host metal.34 Unfortunately, the
new dopants examined in this study (Fe, Co, Ru, and Os) do
not show a thermodynamic tendency for site isolation, with the
rearrangement of isolated sites into trimers being exothermic.
However, they did show that even relatively weakly binding
adsorbates such as hydrogen may help keep the dopant in the
surface layer from segregating to the bulk. Zhang and coworkers also examined the segregation energy and mixing
energy of a variety of dopants (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni,
Cu, and Zn) in Ag(111).41 They found that in the absence of
adsorbates, the dopants prefer to be subsurface and only Sc
and Zn show negative mixing enthalpies (tendency for site
isolation) in the surface layer. While most of the abovementioned work focused on periodic slab calculations, there
has also been some interest in modeling segregation eﬀects in
SAA clusters by Yin and co-workers, who found that the cluster
size plays a role in segregation energies.42
Although not focused on SAAs speciﬁcally, theoretical work
by Nørskov and co-workers examined the mixing of
bimetallics.43 They presented an extensive table of values,
considering most possible combinations of metals in the ﬁrst
three rows of the d-block. However, while serving as a good
guide for SAA formation tendencies, these data should be
interpreted with caution as they do not speciﬁcally examine the
low coverage regime and do not include host metal relaxation.
In an attempt to accelerate the theoretical screening of new
SAA combinations, machine learning has been employed.44,45
Very recently, Rao and co-workers examined the stability of the
SAA conﬁguration relative to subsurface, dimer, and adatom
conﬁgurations with a machine learning based approach.45 They
examined 26 d-block metals in addition to Al and Pb to create
a 28 × 28 database, ﬁnding that for 250 metal combinations,
the SAA conﬁguration is the most stable phase.
Attention must be drawn to the fact that these trends for
surface aggregation and segregation can be inﬂuenced by
interaction with adsorbates. We have already discussed how
adsorbates such as CO and H2 are capable of keeping reactive
dopants in the surface layer vs the bulk of the host, but
adsorbates may also inﬂuence the aggregation of
SAAs.34,35,38,46 Speciﬁcally, while a certain alloy structure
may be favored under vacuum conditions, adsorbates such as
CO, acetylene, and ethene have been shown theoretically to
drive both aggregation and dispersion of isolated sites as a
function of adsorbate surface coverage. As seen in Figure 4,
work by Yang and Yang predicts both RhCu and NiCu are
stable SAAs in vacuum. However, adsorption of strong binding
adsorbates such as acetylene can cause agglomeration.46
Weaker binding SAAs such as PtCu and PdCu do not display

surface composition at reaction temperatures and in response
to the gas or liquid composition surrounding them.
In order to predict new SAA formulations, many theoretical
studies have examined the thermodynamic tendency for
reactive metal dopants to disperse in a less reactive coinage
metal host and form a SAA. To date, some of the most
extensive studies have been conducted by Stamatakis and coworkers who examined Pt, Pd, Ni, Rh, and Ir atoms alloyed
into Cu, Ag, and Au hosts.35,38 For most of these combinations
the dopant is more stable in the bulk than in the surface of the
host metal. However, CO adsorption is shown to be capable of
keeping the dopant in the surface layer due to the strong CO−
dopant bond, known as reverse segregation. Scaling relationships, which relate the adsorption strength of an adsorbate to
the segregation preference of a metal alloy, have also been
presented in the literature.39 Stamatakis and co-workers also
examined the aggregation energy, ﬁnding that most of the
metal combinations display a thermodynamic tendency for the
dopant atom to be isolated and hence form a SAA.35,38 As seen
in Figure 3, PtCu(111) has a positive aggregation energy which

Values of ΔEagg(n) that are negative correspond to a preference for
dopant clustering, whereas positive values correspond to a preference
for dopant atom dispersion to the SAA structure. Insets show

gives rise to isolated Pt sites in Cu, while the near zero
aggregation energy of PtAu(111) gives rise to a mixture of
isolated sites and small ensembles in the model system.
However, SAA combinations with aggregation energies that are
close to zero may still be accessible experimentally in catalysts
operating at elevated temperatures as these calculations neglect
entropic contributions which favor dispersion of the dopant
atom. In fact, NiCu has successfully been prepared as a SAA in
both model surface science studies, as well as in nanoparticle
and nanoporous form.27,33
In an extension of their earlier work, Stamatakis and coworkers moved beyond examining the (111) facet of the host
metal by modeling the stepped (211) and less densely packed

a bimetallic alloy. Under these vacuum conditions surface
cleanliness can be achieved and maintained below 0.01%
impurities, which is essential for studying such dilute alloy
systems.14,15 Typically, ﬁlament style or electron beam
evaporators are used for deposition of trace amounts of the
reactive dopant onto a clean single crystal of the host metal
held at an appropriate alloying temperature. An elevated
temperature (generally around 400 K) is typically necessary to
promote mixing of the metals but cannot be too hot such that
segregation of the dopant to the host metal bulk occurs.26−32
STM studies on the alloying mechanism of model SAAs have
revealed that there are two primary alloying mechanisms: place
exchange of the dopant directly into terraces on the single
crystal host leading to single atoms alloyed in the terraces, or
diﬀusion of the dopant atoms to step edges followed by place
exchange at the step edge into the upper terrace resulting in
isolated dopant atoms present in brims in the areas above the
step edges (Figure 5).31 These mechanisms provide kinetic
limitations on the amount of dopant which can be deposited,
while still remaining dispersed in SAA form. For instance,
despite the existence of bulk Cu3Pt crystals, in which the ideal
surface structure has each Pt atom surrounded by Cu
atoms,51−53 deposition of Pt onto Cu results in some cluster
formation above ∼5% Pt coverage due to the inhomogeneous
alloying mechanism (Figure 5).31
Other groups have prepared similar surfaces via deposition
of relatively large amounts of dopant onto the host metal
followed by prolonged anneals. For instance, a PdAu surface
comprised of primarily isolated Pd sites was prepared by
deposition of 1 monolayer (ML) of Pd on Au(111) at 77 K
followed by a 10 min anneal at 500 K.54 Another method
involves evaporation of both the host and dopant metal onto a

this eﬀect. Similar eﬀects have been probed by Stamatakis and
co-workers, who examined CO induced restructuring.35,38,47
Although they examined a wide range of SAAs, for brevity we
include only one representative example in Figure 4. They
showed that some SAAs such as NiCu (shown in Figure 4)
displayed tunable ensemble composition based on CO
pressure. This is in contrast to other examples such as PtCu
which has a stable isolated phase over a range of CO pressures.
This range of responses to CO is dictated by the relative
binding energies of CO on the diﬀerent ensembles.
To date there have been only a few experimental studies
examining these eﬀects. Work by Anderson and McCue has
shown that as-prepared PdCu nanoparticles could be
restructured in response to high pressures of CO. The asprepared nanoparticles initially contained a low concentration
of Pd monomers in the surface; however, after exposure to
high pressures of CO (100 mL/min ﬂow rate) Pd segregated
to the surface and in some cases resulted in the formation of
ensembles.48 Work by Waluyo and co-workers has also
examined PtCu model SAAs using high-pressure X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy.49,50 They found that CO prevents
segregation of the Pt to the bulk while H2 has little eﬀect on
segregation. While these early studies are interesting, more
experimental work is needed to understand these induced
restructuring eﬀects systematically and to fully test theoretical
predictions.

Characterization

Many of the unique properties of SAAs were ﬁrst realized using
a single-crystal surface science and microscopy approach. In
these model system UHV studies, SAAs are prepared by
depositing small amounts of one metal onto the other to create

conditions like most model systems, Maroun and co-workers
prepared PdAu SAAs via electrochemical coreduction of a
mixture of Pd and Au onto Au(111) as shown in Figure 6.55
These in situ images represent one of a few examples of
atomic-scale imaging of SAAs under reaction conditions. While
extremely challenging, STM experiments conducted under
non-UHV conditions give crucial information about the
evolution of catalyst structure in response to reaction mixtures.
Due to the complexity of understanding reaction mechanisms for working heterogeneous catalysts, there has been
considerable eﬀort to understand reaction steps using surface
science techniques on simpliﬁed model systems.56 SAAs have
especially beneﬁted from this approach with model surface
science, catalysis, and theory forming a feedback loop used to
gain a deeper understanding of the structure and reactivity of
these materials and drive new catalyst design.14,15 Typically,
model SAAs are understood using a combination of STM and
temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). As these model
surfaces are amenable to STM studies, the atomic-scale
structure of the surface can be understood with angstrom
resolution. Since STM has picometer resolution in the z
direction, metal atoms of diﬀerent elements can be clearly seen
in the images, as ﬁrst demonstrated by Varga and co-workers
on a range of bimetallic surfaces.57 The atomic-scale structure
of these model alloy surfaces can be related to their catalytic
properties via temperature-programed desorption experiments.
In these experiments, model systems with a known atomicscale structure (derived via STM) are exposed to reactants and
heated until the reactants undergo reaction or desorb. Since
many temperature-programmed surface reactions are reaction
rate limited, i.e. the products desorb spontaneously once
formed, the temperature at which they desorb yields reaction
barriers. Furthermore, comparison of the various products
which desorb can give information about the reaction
selectivity.58

This combined STM/TPD approach is shown schematically
in Figure 7, in which a molecule AB dissociates liberating B2
gas which is rate limited by A-B cleavage. Then surface bound
A species undergo activated coupling resulting in spontaneous
A2 gas formation. The barriers for A-B cleavage and A-A
coupling are measured by TPD, and the structures of surface

reaction steps (A-B cleavage and A-A coupling). Together, these
methods allow for structure−activity relationships to be understood at
the atomic-scale on well-deﬁned model catalysts.

synthesis of nanoparticle analogs either in supported or
unsupported forms (Table 1). Generally, techniques that had
previously been used for the synthesis of bimetallic alloys have
been used and optimized for the formation of SAA
nanoparticles. Most SAAs reported have been synthesized via
galvanic replacement, sequential reduction, or incipient
wetness coimpregnation. As such we focus on these methods,
but we also point out some other methods for bimetallic
nanoparticle synthesis that may be amenable for SAA
synthesis.
2.3.1. Galvanic Replacement. The ﬁrst synthesis of SAA
nanoparticle catalysts analogous to the model systems came
from the work of Boucher and co-workers, who employed
galvanic replacement or displacement to synthesize PdCu
SAAs.16 Galvanic replacement has been previously used to
synthesize surface alloys and is of particular interest owing to
its simplicity and the fact that no external source of electricity
is required for the displacement. The technique takes

bound intermediates AB* and A* are observed by STM.
Furthermore, model system studies allow researchers to
perform experiments using selective catalyst poisons to
demonstrate the synergistic reactivity of diﬀerent surface sites
in bifunctional reaction mechanisms, which remains diﬃcult to
probe under dynamic ﬂow reactor conditions.14,15,59 Additionally, the behavior of probe molecules common to both the
surface science and chemical engineering communities such as
CO can be examined and cross compared via infrared
experiments in order to characterize the active sites on both
model and high surface area catalysts. Such probe molecules
also provide useful benchmarks for density functional theory
(DFT) calculations.27,30,35,60

Review

This is particularly signiﬁcant, as an important aspect of
catalysis research is decoupling the eﬀect of metal alloy
nanoparticles from that of metal atoms on the support which
can themselves function as single-atom catalysts.
2.3.3. Incipient Wetness Coimpregnation. Arguably,
the techniques just described require multiple steps, various
pretreatments, and the use of diﬀerent glassware, which might
deter the broad use of the above synthesis methods for SAAs.
Instead, a simple, one-pot technique called incipient wetness
coimpregnation has been used to make some SAAs.
Speciﬁcally, metal precursors are mixed in solution and an
appropriate amount is used to ﬁll the pores of the support. The
appropriate amount is dictated by the pore volume of the
support and if exceeded results in diﬀusion limitations. As in
the case of simple incipient wetness impregnation, a broad
particle size distribution is to be expected. Additionally, when
two precursors are mixed (coimpregnation), inhomogeneous
alloys may be formed, although no such issue has been
reported in the catalyst preparation papers that used this
technique.76,82 Another potential issue could be the migration
of dopant metal atoms to the support, which would not allow
for the clear study of the alloy, but this issue has not been
discussed to date. Some examples of SAAs prepared in this way
include, but are not limited to, PdCu and PdAg.73−75,83,84
2.3.4. Strong Electrostatic Adsorption. Another example of an old technique being utilized for the synthesis of highly
dilute alloys is strong electrostatic adsorption, introduced by
the Regalbuto group in a study that oﬀered a better
understanding and explanation regarding the “ion-exchange”
mechanism, described in the pioneering work of Brunelle.85,86
This method is a considerable improvement over wet
impregnation techniques that do not involve control of pH
but lead to pH values close to the support point of zero charge,
ultimately resulting in lack of interaction between the metal
precursor and the support. Instead, strong electrostatic
adsorption relies on the Coulombic nature of the adsorption
of metal complexes onto supports. At the point of zero charge
the surface is neutral and covered by hydroxyl groups. If the
pH value is lower than at the point of zero charge, the surface
hydroxyl groups become protonated (OH2+) and the surface
becomes positive, whereas at pH values above the point of zero
charge, deprotonation occurs yielding negatively charged oxide
surfaces (O−). As a result, strong interaction between the metal
precursor and the surface is contingent upon the charge of the
precursor itself. A positively charged precursor (e.g.,
[(NH3)4Pt]2+ or [(NH3)4Pd]2+) will result in deposition on
the negative oxide surface if the pH value is above the point of
zero charge. For pH values below the point of zero charge,
metal precursors such as chloroplatinic acid [H3O]2[PtCl6](H2O)x, where 0 ≤ x ≤ 6, result in adsorption of Pt species on
the surface.87,88 This technique has been used for the
preparation of highly dispersed noble and base metals on
silica and on carbon xerogels and was recently reported as a
tool to synthesize catalysts comprised of atomically dispersed
Pt supported on TiO2 nanoparticles.89−91 In recent work, the
Regalbuto group focused on utilizing strong electrostatic
adsorption for the preparation of ultrasmall, highly dilute alloys
of various bimetallics.76
2.3.5. Controlled Surface Reaction. The Dumesic group
has in recent years introduced the concept of controlled
surface reaction, as a means to produce bimetallic alloys of
controlled particle size.92 Contrary to the strategy used in the
sequential reduction method, where the alloy is ﬁrst formed in

advantage of the semireduction potential of metal precursors
used for the synthesis of the bimetallic alloys, for example Pd
and Cu. In this case, during galvanic replacement, the reduced
surface of the host metal (Cu) acts as a template for the
deposition of the minority metal (Pd) precursor via metal
exchange as seen in Figure 8.79,80 Selective deposition of the
dopant metal atom in the host metal surface takes place when
the overall potential of the reaction is positive. For that to
happen, usually prereduction of the host metal is a prerequisite
for the formation of a metallic substrate. Occasions where the
surface was partially oxidized (Cu2O) have also been reported
(Pd/Cu2O, Ni/Cu2O).33,81 Host metal atoms become oxidized
upon contact with the dopant metal ions (Rxn I in Figure 8).
As the dopant metal ions are reduced (Rxn II in Figure 8), the
oxidized atoms of the host metal surface dissolve in the
solution. As a general rule, the dopant metal needs to be more
noble than the host metal in nature. The high precision of this
technique renders it a valuable tool in the synthesis of SAA
catalysts such as PtCu, PdCu, PdGa, and RhGa.16,59,61,62 As an
example, for the formation of PtCu SAAs, one has to consider
the semireduction potential of Pt and Cu as shown by the net
equation in Figure 8.
Given the positive overall reduction potential, the displacement of two Cu atoms and their substitution with a Pt atom
results in the formation of isolated Pt atoms in the surface of
Cu. For all the advantages of this technique, certain limitations
arise when the substrate is a noble metal such as Au. In this
case, the resistance of Au to oxidation results in a considerably
negative semireduction potential (Au0 → Au3+ + 3e−, E0 =
−1.5 V), which in turn leads to a negative overall reduction
potential, ultimately rendering the galvanic replacement
reaction pathway unfavorable.
2.3.2. Sequential Reduction. In such cases when the
substrate is a noble metal such as Au, sequential reduction has
been used eﬀectively for the deposition of small amounts of
dopant metals, such as Ni and Pd onto the already synthesized
host metal (e.g., Au) nanoparticles.68,70 As shown in Figure 9,

Figure 9. Schematic representation of the sequential reduction
method for the synthesis of SAAs.

ﬁrst Au nanoparticles are synthesized by reducing the gold
precursor, HAuCl4, in an ethylene glycol solution containing
NaHCO3 at 90 °C. Then appropriate amounts of the dopant
metal precursor and reducing agents (e.g., hydrazine for NiCl2,
ethylene glycol for Pd(ΝΟ3)2) are added via sequential
reduction, leading to the formation of unsupported nanoparticles in ethylene glycol which can then be supported on a
support of choice. While the chemical reactions occurring
during this process are not well understood, the atomic
dispersion of the dopant is largely dictated by the
thermodynamic preference for site isolation; a positive
aggregation energy of two metals will result in a SAA
conﬁguration, as the dopant thermodynamically prefers to be
surrounded by host metal atoms. An advantage of the
technique is that the formation of the alloy is ensured, as it
occurs prior to deposition of metal particles on the support.

fore, careful studies are needed for the optimization of the
electroless deposition method for successful SAA synthesis.
2.3.7. Coreduction. Other studies of the catalytic eﬀect of
Pd and Rh atom doping on small clusters of Au have been
performed by the Tsukuda group using coreduction as a
synthesis method.101,102 These gold clusters are comprised of a
very precise number of gold atoms, forming what are known as
magic gold clusters or gold superatoms.103 In this method the
desirable ratio of Au and Pd precursors (HAuCl4 and
Na2PdCl4, respectively) are mixed in an aqueous solution, in
which a toluene solution of (C8H17)4NBr is added.104 After
removing the organic phase, C12H25SH is added and the
mixture is stirred at 0 °C. Reduction of the precursors takes
place via rapid injection of NaBH4 and vigorous stirring for 3 h.
The organic phase is removed through evaporation and
subsequent extensive washing with methanol. The alloy
clusters can then be deposited on carbon supports and the
ligands are removed by calcination at 200 °C in air or at 450
°C in vacuo.105,106 This synthesis method has allowed for the
careful preparation of small Au clusters with unique properties
compared to bulk Au that allow for bridging between quasihomogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.107
2.3.8. Eﬀect of Support and Nanoporous Materials. It
should be noted that in an eﬀort to further decouple the eﬀect
of the support beyond using nonreducible supports, such as
silica and alumina that are generally considered inert, eﬀorts
have been focused on the synthesis of unsupported nanoporous alloy materials. Nanoporous Au which originates from
the leaching most of the Ag out of an Ag70Au30 alloy has
attracted a lot of attention as a catalyst for a variety of
reactions.108 The Biener group developed a method to
impregnate the resulting nanoporous Au with Ni using
Ni(NO3)2. Upon H2 treatment at high temperatures (above
500 °C), the salt decomposes and the Ni gets reduced and
incorporated into the surface layers of Au as highly dispersed
atoms. These isolated nanoporous NiAu SAAs both suppress
the sintering of the nanoporous Au ligaments and oﬀer
remarkably enhanced catalytic activity vs Au for the
dehydrogenation of ethanol.68
A similar approach was utilized for the synthesis of
nanoporous Cu samples, originating from CuZn alloys,
followed by impregnation with Ni to form nanoporous NiCu
SAAs.33 In the same work by Shan and co-workers, the
sacriﬁcial support method, which was previously introduced by
the Atanassov group, was employed to prepare nanoporous Cu
catalysts that were subsequently doped with Ni atoms using
galvanic replacement.109 The nanoporous Cu sample was
prepared in two steps: ﬁrst incipient wetness impregnation was
used to adsorb the precursor in the precalcined silica pores,
followed by drying and a high reduction temperature treatment
that caused some sintering. Following that, a sacriﬁcial support
method was facilitated by dispersing silica supported Cu
nanoparticles in a highly basic solution (8 M KOH), to
dissolve the silica framework. Galvanic replacement was then
employed for the decoration of the porous copper network
with dopant metal atoms, resulting in the ﬁnal product, a
nanoporous NiCu SAA. These samples exhibited suppression
of sintering at elevated temperature compared to Ni-free
nanoporous Cu structures, while also providing a considerable
boost to alcohol dehydrogenation reaction rates.33 It is thought
that the dopant Ni atoms reside at the sites in the Cu surface
where sintering starts and result in stabilization of the
nanoporous ligaments.

solution and then deposited on a support, in controlled surface
reaction the deposition of the dopant metal is performed on
already supported metal nanoparticles. Particular attention is
paid to ensure that no deposition on the support takes place
and that the dopant metal atoms solely decorate the surface of
the host metal. In a recent report by Ball and co-workers, the
controlled surface reaction method was used for the synthesis
of PdAg alloys of various Pd:Ag compositions, including Pd
dilutions at the single-atom limit.77 The presynthesized Ag/C
catalysts were reduced under hydrogen and transferred to a
glovebox under inert atmosphere. The appropriate amount of
the Pd precursor (cyclopentadienyl palladium allyl) dispersed
in anhydrous pentane was added under constant stirring, and
the ﬁnal catalyst was obtained after evaporation of the npentane and subsequent reduction. Despite the highly
controlled environment and the successful deposition of the
dopant metal as atoms in the surface of the host metal, this
technique requires considerable levels of complexity in terms
of maintaining an inert atmosphere with the use of Schlenk
lines and/or a glovebox.
2.3.6. Electroless Deposition. Electroless deposition is a
process with applications in a wide range of industries, namely
energy conversion, polymers, and catalytic materials, among
others.78 Its use in the synthesis of bimetallic particles proceeds
as follows: a metal nanoparticle supported on an inert substrate
is used to activate an appropriate reducing agent (e.g., N2H4,
BH4−, HCOOH) resulting in population of the metal surface
with chemisorbed H atoms.93 These H atoms are identiﬁed as
the active species for the next step in which the precursor of
the secondary metal is reduced. The addition of the secondary
metal takes place atom-by-atom, and higher loadings can be
achieved by increasing the number of cycles of the process.
This cycling procedure can lead to either the formation of a
shell of the secondary metal or three-dimensional aggregates
on the surface, depending on the pathway followed, catalytic or
autocatalytic, which is dictated by the reaction kinetics of the
salt precursor.94 The electroless deposition process is a
kinetically controlled process where the reaction parameters
such as pH, reducing agents, coordinating ligands for the metal
ions, temperature, and concentration are all tuned to optimize
the deposition.95 The site-speciﬁc deposition for the metals is
obtained via well-controlled kinetics. As an approach to
synthesize bimetallic catalysts, the most important beneﬁts of
the electroless deposition method are (1) it does not require
heat treatment to remove the capping ligands, which can cause
the sintering or segregation of the bimetallic nanoparticles; and
(2) it can be used for deposition of the secondary metal that
cannot be done by the galvanic replacement reaction. One of
the weaknesses of electroless deposition is that catalyst
preparation requires careful optimization of the abovementioned parameters and can be more complex than the
galvanic replacement reaction or sequential reduction methods.
The Monnier group has demonstrated the preparation of a
wide variety of bimetallic catalysts using the electroless
deposition method, such as AuPd, PtPd, CoPt, AgPd, and
CuPd on diﬀerent supports.95−99 While electroless deposition
has not been reported as a tool for the synthesis of SAAs in the
literature, it is a promising candidate for SAA catalyst
preparation due to the controlled nature of the process. In
order to form SAAs on the surface of a host metal using the
electroless deposition method, the autocatalytic deposition of
the secondary metal must be prevented, as it leads to
multilayer deposition or the formation of clusters.100 ThereI

between the alloy and support. While the low surface area of
nanoporous metal catalysts can be a deterring factor in their
widespread use, the industrial Raney nickel hydrogenation
catalyst is a good example of a viable nanoporous metal
catalyst.110
Recent results from Christopher and co-workers have shown
that the support may inﬂuence the surface morphology of
NiCu SAAs.111,112 Speciﬁcally, NiCu particles synthesized on
alumina display extended Ni ensembles while those on titania
display isolated Ni sites. This is due to the stronger interaction
of Ni with titania vs alumina, which results in the migration of
Ni in the titania supported particles to the interface of the
nanoparticle and support. This results in a lower concentration
of Ni in the surface layer, and thus isolated sites are favored via
dilution. This segregation of Ni may also play a role in the
tolerance to sintering exhibited by NiCu SAAs.
2.3.9. Most Relevant Characterization Techniques.
Microscopy is regarded as the most convincing tool for the
characterization of single atom catalysts, as it provides clear
evidence for the isolation of the active metal species on the
support; after all, it has been said by many in the ﬁeld that
“seeing is believing”.113 Despite the pioneering work by Gates
and Stephanopoulos in the early 2000s on the role of cationic
gold species in the ethylene hydrogenation and water−gas shift
reactions, it was not until these atomic species were identiﬁed
using aberration-corrected electron microscopes that great
attention to this novel class of catalysts arose.6−8,114 As
previously mentioned, the atomic structures of SAAs were ﬁrst
visualized via STM, which enabled the atomic structure of both
the host metal surface and the dopant to be resolved. This
approach has been successful for a wide range of Cu, Ag, and
Au based model SAA catalysts. Imaging of high surface area
SAA samples has also been performed with high-angle annular
dark-ﬁeld scanning transmission electron microscopy
(HAADF-STEM). For example, Figure 11 shows an image
of a PtCu sample where one can clearly see the Pt atoms as
bright protrusions in the darker atomic columns of the Cu host
lattice. One of the major drawbacks of STEM is that depending

These nanoporous materials can act as very close analogs of
the single crystal model SAAs developed using surface science,
because nanoporous Au exhibits large crystalline ligaments
with well-deﬁned surface structures. Interestingly, in two cases
where both silica-supported nanoparticles and nanoporous
materials were tested under reaction conditions, the rates
(normalized for surface area) were similar and the apparent
activation energy for ethanol dehydrogenation was similar for
the nanoporous and silica-supported nanoparticle samples.33,68
For NiCu, both the nanoporous and nanoparticle activation
energies were ∼45 kJ/mol. For NiAu, both the nanoporous
and nanoparticle activation energies were ∼60 kJ/mol. The
NiAu data is shown in Figure 10. This result indicates that

A potential drawback of IR characterization is that the probe
molecules themselves can cause changes to the surface (see
section 2.1 for more discussion).47 In such cases, or in cases
when binding of the probe molecule is weak on the dopant
metal (e.g., CO binding on Pd atoms dispersed in an Au
surface), the use of cryogenic conditions is recommended to
obtain cleaner spectra and deconvolute the eﬀects of
restructuring. The identiﬁcation of other probe molecules

on the resolution of the microscope, there must be enough of a
diﬀerence in atomic number for the two metals to be
distinguished, so-called “z-diﬀerence”.65,82
Infrared spectroscopy is another invaluable tool that enables
a deeper understanding of the coordination environment of
dispersed metal atoms and provides a bridge between surface
science studies of model catalysts with reﬂection absorption
infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) and their high surface area
counterparts with diﬀuse reﬂectance infrared Fourier transformed spectroscopy (DRIFTS).115 Owing to its high
resolution (2−4 cm−1) IR spectra of bound molecules provide
unique ﬁngerprints of active sites, allowing very similar but
nonidentical samples to be diﬀerentiated. Probe molecules
such as CO and NO bind in speciﬁc conformations that are
indicative of the type of surface sites present in the
catalyst.27,30,68,82,116,117 For example, characteristic CO stretch
frequencies for CO binding atop a dopant atom in a SAA are

atomic dispersion of Au atoms stabilized by oxygen and alkali
ions.123 A linear relationship between the loading of Au atom
sites, as veriﬁed via EXAFS, and the reactivity under water−gas
shift conditions was observed.
With respect to SAAs, no such studies have yet been
reported; however, evidence that such an approach should
work well can be found in the study on NiAu SAAs catalyst for
the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol.68 The loss of
selectivity at temperatures above 280 °C (Figure 14) was

that would not aﬀect the surface would be beneﬁcial in
extending the capabilities of this technique for analyzing the
surface structure of SAAs.
Such limitations are not present in X-ray absorption
spectroscopy (XAS), perhaps the most powerful technique
for in situ or operando determination of the coordination
environment of the dopant metal atom in single-site
catalysts.119 The wide range of reactor cells and beamline
setups allows for monitoring of the catalysts under gas or liquid
phase environments, at high temperatures and pressures, or
even in vacuo.120,121 Extended X-ray absorption ﬁne structure
(EXAFS) oﬀers the ability to identify the presence of bonds
between the host atoms themselves as well as dopant−host and
dopant−dopant bonds, essential information for understanding
the structure of single atom catalysts. For example, as seen in
Figure 13, lack of Pd−Pd bonds in Pd1Cu40/SiO2 and
Pd1Cu160/SiO2 catalysts is an indication of the successful
formation of PdCu SAA nanoparticles after hydrogen
reduction at 250 °C. At the same time, the corresponding
analysis of the Pd1Cu12/SiO2 and Pd1Cu5/SiO2 catalysts clearly
shows that the coordination number of Pd−Pd is equal to 1.4
and 5.9, respectively, indicating the beginning of Pd cluster
growth.73 While EXAFS is one of the most powerful X-ray
based characterization techniques used to characterize SAAs,
there are numerous other X-ray based techniques that may
provide additional information about the catalysts.122−125
One potential limitation of the EXAFS technique for SAAs is
the need for the experiment to be conducted at synchrotron
facilities with high photon ﬂux beamlines or with the use of
detectors capable of mapping the metal atoms that are present
at very low loadings (a few ppm). Especially in the case of
alloys diluted at the single atom limit, added complexities can
arise and obtaining clear spectra can be challenging. Unique
challenges also appear for pairs such as NiCu and PdAg, which
do not allow for clear discrimination of EXAFS features owing
to their similar edge energies.64,84 In such cases, ﬁtting only the
ﬁrst coordination shell is possible or occasionally linear ﬁtting
combination analysis of the XANES part of the spectrum is
chosen to study the atomic dispersion. Lastly, it should be
noted that XAS is a bulk, not surface, technique and as such
cannot give a full picture of the coordination environment of
the dopant metal in the surface layer without some careful
assumptions about nanoparticle size and dopant distribution.
Some recent reports on PdAu alloys have used a combination
of molecular dynamics and X-ray spectroscopy to overcome
some of these limitations and understand the variation in local
environment of dopant atoms.126,127
A valuable tool that has gone largely unused in the ﬁeld of
single-atom catalyst characterization is the use of probe
reaction testing, which can further aid in the determination
of the atomic dispersion of the active metal. Probe reactions
have been widely used in traditional heterogeneous catalysis
for surface site characterization. Examples include CO
temperature programmed reaction to react with and hence
titrate active OH groups on a support, ethylene hydrogenation
to estimate the metallic surface area of Pt, and DME
carbonylation to probe the local active site structure in
zeolites, among others.6,128,129 Such an approach for singleatom catalysts was introduced by Lu and co-workers, who
studied the CO oxidation reaction to determine surface site
fractions on well-deﬁned Ir catalysts supported on MgAl2O4.130
Another very recent example comes from Cao and co-workers,
in which the water−gas shift reaction was used to report on the

ethanol on silica supported Ni0.005Au/SiO2. Reaction conditions: 400

found to be connected to the growth of Ni clusters, as
conﬁrmed by CO-IR of the used catalyst, which showed a new
feature at 2055 cm−1 corresponding to CO on small Ni
ensembles (Figure 15). We therefore suggest that probe
reactions like this can be used as another way to characterize
SAAs and their structural evolution under diﬀerent reaction
conditions.
To summarize, it is generally accepted that no one technique
is completely capable of verifying the atomic dispersion or local
environment in a single-atom catalyst, but rather information
from two or ideally many techniques is needed to complete the
picture, as each individual technique has limitations, as
discussed above. Furthermore, it is important that in addition
to characterization before and after reaction, in situ studies be
conducted to understand how the surface structure evolves
under reaction conditions. For instance, environmental
transmission electron microscopy and EXAFS can give
information about the change in catalyst structure in response
to reaction conditions.

3. REACTIONS ON SINGLE-ATOM ALLOYS
The concept of single-atom alloys as a new class of
heterogeneous catalyst was ﬁrst described by Sykes and coworkers in 2012.21 Over the last 8 years, considerable eﬀort has
been invested in exploring many diﬀerent reactions on many
diﬀerent alloy combinations of these catalysts. In this section,
we review this work on a reaction-by-reaction basis. While a
great deal of this work has been recent (after 2012), the ﬁeld of
bimetallic catalysis is hardly new. As such, we attempt to draw
parallels when appropriate to older bimetallic work even if the
focus of those works was not on isolated sites speciﬁcally.

metal scaling relationships and can oﬀer catalytic reactivity
superior to conventional catalysts.132,138,139 One experimental
demonstration of this was presented by Alayoglu and coworkers, who examined a variety of Ru−Pt nanoparticles for
the preferential oxidation of CO, ﬁnding that the catalyst with
a thin ﬁlm of Pt over the Ru core demonstrated the lowest
light-oﬀ temperature compared to both the pure metal
particles and the mixed alloy.140 However, due to the dynamic
behavior of alloy catalysts under reaction conditions, near
surface alloys may not keep their ideal “slab on slab”
conﬁguration under reaction conditions which somewhat
limits their utility. SAAs oﬀer an alternative approach for
breaking linear scaling relationships, and the structure of many
SAAs has been shown to remain intact after reactions under
relevant conditions.64,67,68,70
While hydrogen activation has been shown on many SAAs,
we will discuss PtCu as an informative example. As seen in
Figure 16, Lucci and co-workers used STM and TPD
experiments to examine H2 dissociation and recombination
on model SAA surfaces.141 Compared to Cu(111) and Pt(111)
from which H2 desorbs at ∼350 K, on the PtCu SAA H2
desorbs at ∼230 K.141−143 Lucci and co-workers rationalize
this result based on the weak binding of surface hydrogen
atoms (H*) to Cu(111), albeit with a large recombination
barrier to H2, while on Pt(111), the H* binding is strong but

H2 dissociation is an important step in many hydrogenation
reactions such as the hydrogenation of alkenes, alkynes, and
aldehydes, as well as the hydrogenolysis of biomass molecules.
We will ﬁrst review the literature that focuses on hydrogen
dissociation speciﬁcally, as this is common to many types of
hydrogenations, before addressing the above-mentioned
hydrogenations individually in the sections that follow.
The behavior of many monometallic and alloy surfaces
toward H2 dissociation can be described by linear scaling
relationships.131−133 Such relationships allow for the prediction
of the catalytic properties of a surface by consideration of the
binding strength of some set of simple species. Unfortunately,
linear scaling leads to a compromise between reactivity and
selectivity because a more reactive metal surface can activate
reactants, but at the cost of strong binding, which can lead to
loss of selectivity.134 Therefore, a great challenge in catalyst
design is how to make catalysts that can combine both activity
and selectivity, essentially escaping linear scaling relationships.135−137 Such eﬀorts include the introduction of near
surface alloys introduced by the Mavrikakis group. In a series
of publications they demonstrated theoretically how bimetallic
alloys in which a single atomic layer of one element is either
deposited on top of another metal or sandwiched between the
surface and subsurface layer of another metal escape the single

Cu(111).147,148 This behavior was termed the “molecular cork”
eﬀect.147 On systems such as PdAu, adsorbates such as CO or
small hydrocarbons are necessary to push the hydrogen from
the Pd sites onto the Au.71,149 Unlike PdCu and PtCu, the
hydrogen actually desorbs at a lower temperature directly from
the Au as the barrier for recombination of Au is lower than the
energy needed for CO to desorb from the Pd sites.71,147−149
Theoretical modeling of these systems has proven somewhat
diﬃcult for reactions involving hydrogen, with standard DFT
and microkinetic modeling failing to explain all experimental
observations.150 For instance, the ﬁrst report of hydrogen
dissociation and spillover on PdCu SAAs came from Sykes and
co-workers who found that this process occurs at liquid helium
temperatures, implying a very low barrier.146 Although other
theoretical studies and molecular beam experiments qualitatively agreed that adding isolated Pd sites to a Cu host
improved the activity, the calculated and beam measured H2
activation energy barriers were ∼0.3 eV, too high to explain
facile H2 activation at 5 K.34,151−153 However, a more recent
theoretical paper addressed these discrepancies by taking into
account the quantum tunneling of hydrogen through the
dissociation barrier using a quantum path integral approach.150
It was found that H2 could tunnel through the dissociation
barrier which became negligible at temperatures below 100 K,
explaining why the apparent barrier based on the LT-STM
results is much lower than those calculated and measured at
higher temperature. Although these quantum eﬀects for
hydrogen are very prominent at low temperatures, they play
much less or no role under typical reaction conditions.

the recombination barrier is negligible. Signiﬁcantly, on the
PtCu SAA the H atoms are bound weakly and also have a low
recombinational barrier as seen in Figure 16. Microscopic
reversibility dictates that the barriers are the same for both H2
dissociation and recombination; hence, the SAA oﬀers both
low H2 activation barriers and weak binding of the H atoms.
Therefore, for this SAA linear scaling is broken for H2
dissociation as the SAA exhibits both the weak binding of
H* to Cu and the low H2 dissociation barrier of Pt. This
appears to be a general property of SAAs for H2 dissociation as
Stamatakis and co-workers calculated H2 dissociation and H
atom binding for 12 SAAs and found signiﬁcant deviations
from linear scaling.144 Deviations are even greater when
spillover of hydrogen from the dopant atom to adjacent sites
on the host metal is considered.15 With respect to other
theoretical studies, Hoyt and co-workers have also used
machine learning to examine the binding strength of hydrogen
on a variety of dilute Ag(211) based alloys in an attempt to
improve understanding across a wide range of dopants.145
Hydrogen activation and spillover has been demonstrated on
multiple SAAs and examined with a combination of experiment
and theory. For some systems such as PdCu and PtCu spillover
is facile and occurs even at cryogenic temperatures.141,146 Sykes
and co-workers examined the role of secondary adsorbates on
hydrogen desorption from SAAs, ﬁnding that blocking the
dopant metal sites with adsorbates like CO can alter the
hydrogen desorption pathway.147−149 For systems such as
PdCu and PtCu, blocking the dopant sites results in the
hydrogen remaining on the surface until a higher temperature
due to the high barrier for hydrogen recombination on

for hydrogenation reactions has been published, which we now
address, starting with acetylene hydrogenation.
Acetylene hydrogenation has received widespread interest
because it represents the simplest alkyne and has industrial
relevance. Industrially, acetylene hydrogenation is often done
in excess ethene to prevent catalyst poisoning via acetylene in
the ethene polymerization process. For this application, it is
desirable to selectively hydrogenate the acetylene to ethene
without hydrogenation of ethene to ethane.156 A variety of
SAAs have been examined experimentally and theoretically for
this reaction which we will now discuss.
Cao and co-workers investigated acetylene hydrogenation
on PdCu SAA nanoparticles prepared via three methods:
galvanic replacement, coimpregnation, and sequential impregnation. They found that all three sets of catalysts display
relatively high selectivity to ethene and the catalysts formed via
wetness impregnation were the most stable.157 Moving beyond
Cu host metals, Zhang and collaborators examined PdCu,
PdAg, and PdAu SAAs.72−75 Focusing on PdCu ﬁrst, they
found that dilute Pd in Cu gave high conversion and good
selectivity, while higher loadings of Pd decreased the selectivity
considerably (Figure 19). When comparing Pd in diﬀerent host
metals, they found PdCu displayed the highest conversion as
well as selectivity. Conversion for PdAu and PdAg were similar
to PdCu, but the PdAu catalyst selectivity was much worse.
The authors attributed this behavior to the more electron-rich
environment of the Pd atom in Cu(111) compared to the Pd
atom in Au(111) based on DFT calculations. The authors also

The unique capability of SAAs to escape linear scaling
relationships and provide a pathway for low-temperature
hydrogen dissociation has rendered them as promising
catalytic systems for the development of eﬃcient and selective
hydrogenation processes. As such, a great number of studies
have been devoted to their application in a variety of
hydrogenation reactions. We now examine these reactions in
detail below.
3.2. Hydrogenation of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons

Hydrogenation of organic molecules is one of the earliest
processes requiring the use of catalysts and still plays an
important role in upgrading chemicals to higher value
products.1 Kinetically, the proposed mechanism by Horiuti
and Polanyi describes the process in a series of steps:
dissociative adsorption of hydrogen, adsorption of the reactant,
and attack of the unsaturated bonds by hydrogen.154 On
catalysts containing more than one active site, it is possible that
the hydrogen activation takes place at one site, while the
hydrogenation happens at another site. In that case, an
intermediate step of hydrogen atom spillover is required.155 In
the preceding section we addressed both hydrogen activation
and spillover, and we now turn to examining the hydrogenation step speciﬁcally. In this section, we deal with
unsaturated hydrocarbons such as styrene, acetylene, hexyne,
and butadiene which have been examined on a variety of SAAs
with both model systems and nanoparticle catalysts.
The ﬁrst major report of hydrogenation of alkynes by SAAs
comes from Sykes and co-workers. Their early model system
work demonstrated that PdCu SAAs were capable of catalyzing
H2 dissociation and the hydrogen could spill over onto the
Cu.146 Additionally, TPD results indicated that the PdCu SAA
was active and selective for both styrene and acetylene partial
hydrogenation reactions as seen in Figure 17.21 This approach
was then transitioned from surface science to real catalysts, in
which nanoparticle analogs of PdCu SAAs were synthesized by
Stephanopoulos and co-workers and tested for the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene as seen in Figure 18.16 An
approximately 10-fold increase in reactivity was measured for
the Pd0.18Cu15 nanoparticles compared to Cu. At the same
time, the PdCu SAA catalyst demonstrated a comparable rate
of hydrogenation to Pd catalysts when normalized for Pd
loading, while maintaining high selectivity to styrene, the
partially hydrogenated product. Following this ﬁrst report that
the SAA concept could be translated to nanoparticle catalysts,
a great deal of work describing the catalytic properties of SAAs

nanoparticles lost 90% of their initial reactivity. Lucci and
co-workers showed via model system TPDs that this is due to
the weaker binding of CO to isolated Pt sites compared to
extended Pt (Figure 21). Similar results were reported by
Simonovis and co-workers who examined PtCu SAAs with
high-pressure XPS.50 They found that PtCu SAAs displayed
CO tolerance because on the SAA more than half the Pt sites
are CO free at 300 K. However, higher pressures of CO were
capable of blocking all the Pt sites.
An important consideration for any reaction is the eﬀect of
the reactants themselves on the structure of the active sites.
DFT investigations of NiCu, PtCu, PdCu, and RhCu SAAs by
Yang and Yang demonstrated that acetylene adsorption can
result in surface restructuring.46 Speciﬁcally, their work
suggests that the strong binding of acetylene is responsible
for NiCu and RhCu SAAs forming dimers, trimers, and
tetramers, while PdCu and PtCu are insensitive to the reaction
environment and maintain atomic dispersion of the dopant
metal. Interestingly, when the reaction environment changes to
ethylene, theory suggests that RhCu surfaces are stable as
SAAs, while on NiCu SAAs cluster formation is favored. These
theoretical calculations act as an important reminder that
surface structure is not static and that certain molecules that
interact strongly can have adverse eﬀects. For further
discussion of these restructuring eﬀects, see section 2.1.
There has also been interest in the selective hydrogenation
of longer chain alkynes. Flytzani-Stephanopoulos and coworkers examined the selective hydrogenation of hexyne to
hexene in liquid-phase.70,71 They found a 10-fold increase of
the activity for PdAu SAAs compared to pure Au, while the
SAA selectivity remained at 100%. Detailed investigations
combining surface science, theory, and catalytic studies were
employed to obtain a deeper understanding of the reaction
mechanism and to explain the origin of the increased SAA
reactivity, which was identiﬁed as the more facile H2
dissociation on Pd-doped surfaces. Speciﬁcally, H2 dissociation
was determined to be the rate limiting step as a signiﬁcant
kinetic isotope eﬀect (∼1.87) was observed when comparing
reaction rates using deuterium instead of hydrogen. The
reaction order with respect to 1-hexyne was zero, while the
reaction rate was proportional to the hydrogen partial pressure
in the reactor (1st order reaction). Activation energy
measurements on H2−D2 exchange, as well as those on 1hexyne hydrogenation reaction yield similar Ea values (∼42 kJ/
mol), further demonstrating the involvement of hydrogen
dissociation on the rate-determining step. While hydrogen
spillover onto Au is not spontaneous under UHV conditions
without an adsorbate such as CO or hexyne pushing the
hydrogen from the Pd site to the Au, under the higher
pressures of H2 at which typical hydrogenation reactions are
run this spillover process may be favored.71,146,149 Of particular
interest in these studies is that the high selectivity of the SAA
catalyst toward 1-hexene does not originate from the
diﬀerential binding energy of the product vs the reactant, but
rather to a unique capability of the Pd single atom in Au to
only activate the carbon directly bound on the surface which
leads to the 1-hexene selectively.70,71 Furthermore, unsupported PdAu SAA nanoparticles used in a batch reactor
exhibited similar reactivity to the supported samples, indicating
no support eﬀect in the reaction. Flow reactor studies veriﬁed
the beneﬁcial role of a high dispersion of Pd in retaining high
activity and selectivity over prolonged tests under reaction
conditions.

conducted microcalorimetry measurements to show that
acetylene binds more weakly to isolated sites in PdCu
compared to larger ensembles.
There has also been interest in acetylene hydrogenation
from a theoretical perspective. For instance, work by Zhang
and co-workers examined acetylene hydrogenation on a series
of Cu based SAAs. They considered Ni, Ag, Au, Pt, Pd, and Rh
as dopants in a stepped Cu(211) surface.158 They found that
some isolated dopants such as Pd and Ag favor desorption of
C2H4, while other dopants lead to over hydrogenation
resulting in loss of selectivity. Furthermore, work by Yang
and Yang concluded that adsorbates may aggregate strongly
binding dopants such as Rh and Ni into ensembles that
promote unselective chemistry.46 Jørgensen and Grönbeck
pointed out that modeling work using ﬂat surfaces may not
reﬂect the complexity of nanoparticles and examined PdCu
SAA surfaces as well as nanoparticles using DFT and kinetic
Monte Carlo simulations.159 The role of corner sites was
predicted to detrimentally aﬀect selectivity, which can be
reduced by synthesis of large nanoparticles with predominant
(111) facets. Thirumalai and Kitchin investigated acetylene on
PdAg and PdAu SAAs, concluding that the formation of the
vinyl intermediate is very favorable, but the binding of ethene
is weak enough to favor desorption of ethene without further
hydrogenation.160
Moving beyond previous work on UHV model systems,
Kruppe and co-workers used high pressure RAIRS on model
systems to bridge the pressure gap between model UHV
systems and real catalysts.161 They were able to simultaneously
monitor the gas and surface bound species on model
PdCu(111) SAAs as seen in Figure 20 and found similar

values of acetylene to ethylene turnover frequency to real
catalysts. The authors clearly demonstrated that the reaction
only takes place on a Cu surface with embedded Pd atoms, and
the reaction mechanism leads ﬁrst to the formation of vinyl
species, which are then further hydrogenated to form the
products. The favorable formation of the vinyl intermediate on
the SAA surface is also supported by theoretical work.160
Acetylene hydrogenation was also chosen as a probe reaction
to test the CO poisoning resistance of PtCu SAAs by Liu and
co-workers.63 As seen in Figure 21, when the catalysts were
tested using acetylene hydrogenation reactions with ppm levels
of CO coﬂowing in the reactor, a drop in the catalytic activity
equal to 50% was observed for SAAs, while pure Pt

Similar experiments were conducted by Friend and coworkers, who examined the gas-phase hydrogenation of 1hexyne on a series of PdAu alloys.162,163 Unlike the previous
reports of Flytzani-Stephanopoulos and co-workers, the
nanoparticles used by Friend and co-workers were embedded
in raspberry colloid-templated silica which prevented sintering
of the catalysts at elevated temperatures. They report 97%
selectivity for 1-hexene at 50% conversion and explain this high
selectivity based on the weaker binding of 1-hexene to isolated
Pd atoms which promotes desorption over further hydrogenation. Furthermore, Friend and co-workers showed that
catalyst pretreatment (CO, O2, etc.) can have a signiﬁcant
impact on the hydrogenation of 1-hexyne over PdAu SAAs.
Pretreatment eﬀects have also been discussed by Zhang and
co-workers, who showed that low pressure radio frequency
hydrogen plasma treatments decrease the selectivity in
acetylene hydrogenation due to the formation of Pd
ensembles.164
The hydrogenation of butadiene to butene has also been
considered and, similarly to acetylene hydrogenation, is
industrially relevant to the polymer industry. In another early
combined surface science and catalysis publication, Lucci and
co-workers investigated the selective hydrogenation of 1,3butadiene to butene using PtCu SAAs in nanoparticle and
single crystal form.59 Using model surface science studies Lucci
and co-workers found that PtCu SAAs catalyzed hydrogen
dissociation and hydrogenation of butadiene to butene, while
higher Pt surface coverages caused butadiene decomposition as
shown in Figure 22. Similar experiments on pure Cu did not
result in hydrogenation as the Cu surface was inactive for
hydrogen dissociation under these conditions. Furthermore,
ﬂow reactor work demonstrated that the temperature at which
100% conversion to butenes was achieved was about 50 °C
lower than Cu/Al2O3, but the reaction over the SAA was just
as selective as the Cu based catalyst. Model PtCu(111) SAAs
also showed great stability over 18 consecutive cycles of
butadiene hydrogenation, H2 activation, and active site
titration with CO indicating that the Pt atoms in Cu are not
poisoned, lost to the bulk, or sintered during butadiene
hydrogenation. The PtCu SAA nanoparticle analogs also
exhibited high stability when tested under industrially relevant
conditions. When propylene was cofed with the reactants
(butadiene and H2) in the ﬂow reactor, only ∼1% propylene

was lost to propane, while butadiene was selectively transformed to butene for 24 h on stream, as seen in Figure 23.
The remarkable catalytic behavior of the SAA catalyst was
attributed to the bifunctional nature of the surface, where Pt
atoms are responsible for the facile dissociation of H2 and
subsequent spillover of H atoms to the Cu surface, where the
hydrogenation reaction to butene occurs, without undergoing
further hydrogenation to butane.14 While this type of

bifunctionality is diﬃcult to demonstrate under ﬂow reactor
conditions, Lucci and co-workers conducted experiments
where they exposed the surface to hydrogen and then
poisoned the Pt sites with CO and adsorbed butadiene.
They found that the reaction proceeds at the same temperature
regardless of whether the Pt sites are free or occupied by
COstrong evidence that the hydrogenation step occurs
solely on Cu sites and hence the PtCu model catalyst is
bifunctional.14,59
DFT calculations and microkinetic modeling studies have
also examined the hydrogenation of butadiene on PtCu
surfaces. Using a combination of DFT and microkinetic
modeling, Yang and Yang showed that the barrier for
hydrogenation is similar on Cu and PtCu SAAs and that
butene desorption is favored over further hydrogenation. This
suggests that selectivity in this reaction is derived by virtue of
the product butene desorbing before it undergoes further
hydrogenation.165 Furthermore, they found that restructuring
of the isolated Pt sites into small ensembles may occur through
the interaction of butadiene. While we expect these
restructuring eﬀects will only occur at relatively high pressures,
they certainly warrant further investigation.
As mentioned in section 2.3.7, there has been interest in
doping small Au clusters with isolated atoms as reviewed by
Han and co-workers.13 Hasegawa and co-workers examined
the hydrogenation of a series of hydrocarbons using small gold
clusters doped with Pd and Rh.102 Speciﬁcally they examined
1-dodecene, styrene, and cyclooctene at conditions under
which Au is barely active (below 1% conversion). Rh-doped
catalysts were consistently more active than Pd-doped samples
(conversion values of 10 vs 90%, 33 vs 95%, and 2 vs 83% for
1-dodecene, styrene, and cyclooctene, respectively), while the
SAAs also exhibited resistance to the overhydrogenation of 1dodecane (75% selectivity to 1-dodecane), unlike PdAu SAAs
(33% selectivity).
A wide range of SAAs have been used for selective
hydrogenation reactions and in particular for the conversion
of alkynes to their corresponding alkenes. This work has
demonstrated a remarkable selectivity for alkenes over alkanes
which are the products of overhydrogenation, and often occurs
on extended platinum-group metal surfaces. Furthermore, they
display high stability due to the inability of many SAAs to
break C−C bonds, which usually leads to deactivation via the

formation of coke. It is also noteworthy that the combination
of theoretical (microkinetic modeling, DFT, KMC), surface
science, as well as reactor (kinetic and spectroscopic)
investigations is essential to a full understanding of the role
of the dopant metal atoms in the unique behavior of these SAA
catalysts. The promising performance of SAAs is not limited to
the hydrogenation of alkynes but extends to other molecules,
such as unsaturated aldehydes and other oxygenates, as is
discussed in the following section.
3.3. Hydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis of Oxygen
Containing Hydrocarbons

In these sections we will cover hydrogenation and hydrogenolyses of oxygen containing hydrocarbons. We have
classiﬁed these reactions into two groups based on the
preservation or cleavage of C−X bonds (where X is not H).
The ﬁrst section below deals with the selective hydrogenation
of unsaturated aldehydes without C−X cleavage, examining
speciﬁcally if CO or CC hydrogenation takes place. The
second section deals with the reforming of biomass type
molecules under hydrogenolysis conditions where C−X
cleavage does occur. All molecules examined in both these
sections are small oxygen containing hydrocarbons comprised
of O, C, and H without additional functionalization. Hydrogen
activation is obviously an important step in these reactions and
has been demonstrated on many SAAs. For an in-depth
discussion of hydrogen activation, see section 3.1.
3.3.1. Hydrogenation of Unsaturated Aldehydes. The
hydrogenation of oxygen-containing hydrocarbons is often an
essential step in chemical reﬁnement.166 While the hydrogenation of alkenes and alkynes has been extensively studied
on SAAs as previously discussed (see section 3.2), there is
much less work on oxygenates. One area of interest has been
the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes which is
an essential step in the processing of ﬁne chemicals. The
diﬃculty lies in the selective hydrogenation of the C = O bond
vs the normally preferred CC hydrogenation.167−169
Typically, small molecules such as acrolein, crotonaldehyde,
or cinnamaldehyde are used as proxies for more complex
molecules to understand the relative selectivity for CO vs
CC hydrogenation, with the most desirable route being the
selective hydrogenation of the CO bond yielding the
corresponding unsaturated alcohol.169

catalysts synthesized via coincipient wetness impregnation. All samples are supported on SiO2. 2% Pd/SiO2 and 0.05% Pd + 8% Ag/SiO2 were
tested at 100 °C and 5 atm pressure; the reaction temperature of 0.01% Pd + 8% Ag, 0.03% Pd + 8% Ag/SiO2, and 8% Ag/SiO2 was 200 °C, and

The ﬁrst experimental report in this area comes from Meyer
and co-workers, who examined acrolein hydrogenation on
various PdAg SAAs prepared via both co- and sequential wet
incipient wetness impregnations.84 As seen in Figure 24, they
found that low loadings of Pd in Ag facilitated the conversion
of acrolein to allyl alcohol without decreasing the selectivity
compared to similar sized Ag particles. It is worth noting that
care should be taken when comparing the 2%Pd and 0.05%Pd
+ 8%Ag catalysts with the 0.03%Pd + 8%Ag, 0.01%Pd + 8%Ag,
and 8%Ag in the paper as the ﬁrst two were run at 100 °C and
the last three at 200 °C. Interestingly, when comparing equal
sized Ag and PdAg nanoparticles, Meyer and co-workers found
that the PdAg catalysts displayed higher selectivity than
comparably sized monometallic silver nanoparticles. To further
understand these results, the authors conducted DFT studies
and found that the isolated Pd sites bind acrolein through the
CC bond. Previous work has shown that favorable
hydrogenation of the CO bond may occur even when the
CC part of the molecule is in contact with the surface.168
Additionally, Meyer and co-workers found that the isolated Pd
sites facilitated H2 dissociation and spillover onto the Ag
surface in much the same way as earlier work on PdCu
SAAs.21,84 They also noted that this is an example of linear
scaling being broken, with the Pd sites having a low barrier for
H2 dislocation but also displaying weak binding, i.e., the “best
catalytic behavior” of both metals.84
Another report of hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes
on SAAs by Hayashi and co-workers examined small gold
clusters doped with a single Pd atom.101 The majority of
clusters in their synthesis were poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)
stabilized PdAu33 and PdAu43 as evidenced by mass spectroscopy. Hayashi and co-workers examined these particles for the
hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. They found that addition of
isolated Pd atoms had a dramatic eﬀect on conversion,
increasing from 6% on Au to 96% on PdAu. Furthermore, they
found that the Pd atom alters the selectivity from favoring the
alcohol on Au to the aldehyde on PdAu. The isolated Pd sites
thus facilitate the CC hydrogenation reaction. The authors
concluded that the activity is likely the result of Pd catalyzed
H2 dissociation, in agreement with previous reports on PdAu
samples.
The ﬁnal and most recent reports of unsaturated aldehyde
hydrogenation on SAAs comes from Zaera and co-workers.170,171 They examined cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation on
PtCu SAAs. They found that adding small amounts of Pt to Cu

increased both activity and selectivity for the CO hydrogenation product, cinnamyl alcohol. Interestingly, they note
that the catalyst became oxidized after the reaction despite the
reducing environment. Although their XPS results conﬁrm the
presence of Pt in the near surface region, they conducted
RAIRS experiments and were unable to see CO bound to Pt
for any Pt coverages less than 20%. This led the authors to
conclude a more complex mechanism must be at play. Either
the Pt atoms segregate to the surface under reaction conditions
or subsurface Pt is able to catalyze H2 dissociation. The latter
explanation seems unlikely in light of DFT results, which have
found that an isolated Pd atom in the subsurface of Cu(111)
has a negligible eﬀect on the barrier for H2 dissociation.153 In
an extension of their initial work, Zaera and co-workers
conducted a kinetic study on the hydrogenation of
cinnamaldehyde, concluding that the selectivity is controlled
by the initial rate constants for the CO and CC
hydrogenation products.171
In conclusion, SAAs have proven to be eﬀective catalysts for
the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes. Generally, the isolated sites act to supply hydrogen which
considerably increases the activity over the host metal.
Interestingly, SAAs are not always selective for the same
products. While PdAu is highly selective for CO hydrogenation, PdAg and PtCu SAAs are selective for CC
hydrogenation84,101,170,171 This suggests that diﬀerent metal
combinations may be able to catalyze diﬀerent pathways.
However, a systematic understanding of these trends is
currently lacking and a combination of well-deﬁned model
system, nanoparticle catalyst, and theoretical studies should
help to answer these questions.
3.3.2. Hydrogenolysis of Biomass Type Molecules.
Hydrogenolysis reactions involve the cleavage of a C−X bond
(where X is not H) under hydrogenation conditions. They are
especially important in biomass reforming, where the goal is to
reform biomass into chemicals more suited for our current
energy infrastructure.172 In a sense, these reactions are quite
distinct from most of the other work on SAAs because they
involve the cleavage of C−X bonds rather than their creation
or preservation. While there has been work on well-studied
SAAs such as NiCu, PtCu, and PdAu, there have also been
reports of more reactive host materials such as Rh, Ni, Pt, and
Co. While these types of SAAs are quite distinct from most
other SAA work which uses Cu, Ag, and Au as the host

of magnitude higher reactivity compared to monometallic Pt
particles.
As mentioned above, biomass formation has also been
examined on SAAs with more reactive host metalsRh, Pt, Ni,
and Co. Very recently, Gan and co-workers prepared a variety
of Co based SAAs (PtCo, PdCo, RhCo, IrCo, and RuCo) via a
ball milling procedure and examined the hydrodeoxygenation
of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural.176 They found that they could
achieve 100% 5-hydroxymethylfurfural conversion with ∼93%
selectivity to dimethylfuran using the PtCo SAA catalyst. They
comment on the synergistic role of the Pt and Co sites, with
the hydrogen activation occurring on the Pt site, and a charge
redistribution from Co to Pt resulting in favoring the
adsorption of the C−O bonds of the reactant over the furan
ring. In an earlier report, Chia and co-workers examined the
hydrogenolysis of polyols and cyclic ethers over ReRh catalysts
using a combination of theory and experiment.177 Their
experimental work showed a high selectivity for the conversion
of 2-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydropyran to 1,6-hexanediol on a
Rh-ReOx/C catalyst. Although the atomic ratio of this
bimetallic was 1:0.5 Rh to Re and thus it is not likely to be
a SAA, their DFT modeling did consider isolated Re sites in
Rh. These results suggest that hydroxyl groups on isolated Re
sites may facilitate these types of reactions and certainly
warrant further investigation at lower dopant loadings.
More recently, there have also been theoretical screening
studies focused on isolated dopants in Pt(111) and Ni(111)
hosts for phenol hydrodeoxygenation to benzene using a
combination of DFT and microkinetic modeling. Work by Jia
and co-workers examined a variety of dopants in Pt(111) as
well as on Pt(111) in an overlayer structure.178 Out of the
various structures examined, they found Ti, Mo, and V isolated
sites in a Pt host to be the most promising candidates as they
fall near the top of the volcano plot. In a similar study Zhou
and co-workers studied dopants in Ni(111) with a similar
approach.179 They found that Fe, Re, Mn, Mo, and Cr atoms
displayed the proper oxophilicity to be found near the top of
the volcano plot and display optimum activity for the
hydrodeoxygenation of phenol as shown in Figure 26.
Furthermore, they discovered that the isolated dopant in the
alloy alters the electronic structure of the adjacent metal atoms,
shifting the d-band center up and increasing OH* binding
strength. Furthermore, they found with a Ni based SAA that
the d-band model is a good predictor of binding strength, in

material, we feel their inclusion is warranted as they contain
dilute isolated metal atom sites in another metal.
Hydrogenolysis of furfural type molecules has been reported
on both NiCu and PdAu SAAs. Christopher and co-workers
examined the hydrodeoxygenation of furfural on Al2O3 and
TiO2 supported NiCu nanoparticles.111,112 Interestingly, the
dilute NiCu nanoparticles on Al2O3 exposed continuous
domains of Ni at the surface, while the TiO2 supported alloy
particles exposed mostly single, isolated Ni atom sites. While
we will not focus explicitly on the role of the support here, the
reader is pointed to section 2.3.8 for a more detailed discussion
of these types of eﬀects. Using these nanoparticles, Christopher
and co-workers found that extended ensembles of Ni favored
ring hydrogenation and conversion to tetrahydrofurfuryl
alcohol and furfural alcohol, while isolated Ni sites favored
carbonyl hydrogenolysis leading to methyl furan. They
rationalized these observations based on the preferential
binding of furfural to Ni ensembles through the ring but
preferential binding to the NiCu SAA through carbonyl
coordination. In a study on a related molecule, Zhu and coworkers recently reported the conversion of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural via ring opening to products such as 1-hydroxy-2,5hexanedione with >90% selectivity at 100% conversion on
PdAu SAAs.173
There has also been interest in reactions of noncyclic
biomass molecules such as glycerol and methyl glycolate on
SAAs. Yang and co-workers reported methyl glycolate
hydrogenolysis to ethanol.174 Of the diﬀerent Pt:Cu ratios
tested, the one corresponding to a PtCu SAA oﬀered the
highest activity, selectivity, and stability over more than 700 h
on stream. The extraordinary performance of the catalyst was
attributed to the enhanced dispersion that allowed for an
increased Cu+/Cu0 ratio and the ability of Pt atoms to
selectively activate H2 while leaving C−C bonds intact.
Furthermore, Zhang and co-workers reported hydrogenolysis
of glycerol to produce 1,2-propanediol on PtCu SAAs.175 As
seen in Figure 25, the PtCu SAA displays a very high TOF
compared to either monometallic component. The authors
conducted DFT modeling and in situ measurements to show
that the Pt atoms act as sites for C−H cleavage, while
neighboring Cu atoms are responsible for the dissociation of
the terminal C−O bond. The SAA catalyst provided not only
close to 100% selectivity for 1,2-propanediol, but also an order

studies, Cu based SAAs have shown the capacity to break C−
O bonds under certain conditions.175 Furthermore, alloying
dopants into hosts such as Ni and Pt can facilitate this more
diﬃcult bond cleavage.178,179 These results are particularly
exciting as they open up the possibility of the discovery of
many more combinations of SAAs not based on coinage metals
that can perform more challenging reaction steps. Compared
to simple hydrocarbon hydrogenations, which are well
understood using a combination of model surface science
studies, DFT, and reactor work, considerable work is still
needed in the area of hydrodeoxygenations to gain a deeper
understanding of what drives SAA reactivity and selectivity.
3.4. Dehydrogenation of Hydrocarbons

Due to the recent increase in abundance of natural gas,
dehydrogenation of light hydrocarbons has received considerable attention in heterogeneous catalysis.180 One of the
major problems associated with these reactions, especially on
platinum group metals, is catalyst deactivation by coke
formation.181 Through a combination of experimental and
theoretical work, SAAs have emerged as a potential solution to
this issue by activating the desirable C−H bonds but exhibiting
high barriers for subsequent dehydrogenation steps that lead to
carbon formation.67,82 This section will discuss the formative
experimental results on PtCu SAAs and analogous results on
supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions
(SCALMS) and end with a discussion of theoretical understanding of and predictions for these systems.
Two research groups have experimentally demonstrated
coke free C−H activation and alkane dehydrogenation on Pt
based SAAs.67,82 The ﬁrst report by Marcinkowski and coworkers used a combined surface science and ﬂow reactor
approach to examine the dehydrogenation of butane to butene
on PtCu SAAs.67 Marcinkowski and co-workers performed
surface science experiments to determine the eﬀect of diﬀerent
amounts of Pt in Cu(111) on reactivity using MeI as a model
molecule. They found that Cu surfaces exhibit high barriers for
C−H activation in surface bound CH3 fragments but do not

contrast to the work of Kitchin and co-workers on Cu, Ag, and
Au based SAAs. This discrepancy suggests that there may be a
fundamental diﬀerence between doping metals into Ni vs Cu,
Ag, or Au hosts (see section 4.3 for more details).160,179 While
many of the metal combinations presented in these DFT
studies have yet to be experimentally validated, they are
important ﬁrst steps in systematically understanding SAAs
using elements other than coinage metals as hosts. They also
serve to examine new SAAs for new classes of reactions and
hence extend the SAA concept across the periodic table.
While most of the work on SAAs has highlighted their
capacity to leave C−X (where X is not H) bonds intact, these
studies highlight that this is not always the case. SAAs based on
coinage metal hosts generally display low activity for C−X
bond cleavage because pairs of more catalytically active metals
are needed to break these bonds. In the aforementioned

promising results for the PtAg SAA system (32% vs 41%
propane conversion at 600 °C).82
SCALMS are very new to the ﬁeld of heterogeneous
catalysis, with the ﬁrst reported example by Wasserscheid and
co-workers in 2017.62,182 These materials are formed by adding
a mixture of gallium and a platinum group metal to a support
material.61,62,182−187 Unlike previous PdGa intermetallic
compounds, these SCALMS are rich in Ga and have much
lower melting points such that they are liquid under catalytic
conditions.62,188−191 Due to the liquid nature of this class of
materials, the porous nature of the support material is essential
for stabilizing the gallium droplets and preventing agglomeration. Most of the published research to date on the reactivity
of these materials has focused on alkane dehydrogenation.61,62,183−185 We consider these materials to be analogous
to SAAs, as the dopant atoms exist as isolated sites in the much
less reactive metal host. To date, studies have examined PdGa
SCALMS for butane dehydrogenation and both PtGa and
RhGa for propane dehydrogenation.61,62,183−185 Generally,
these studies have pointed to the beneﬁcial role of the isolated
dopant atom in promoting C−H activation while the dilution
by the less active Ga matrix prevents signiﬁcant coke formation
and preserves long-term activity. In fact, as seen in Figure 28,
the PdGa catalyst showed improved activity and selectivity
compared to industrial catalysts under demanding butane ﬂow
conditions. A similar approach has also been reported by
McFarland and co-workers, who examined a molten mixture of
27% Ni and 73% Bi for the pyrolysis of methane.192 The
insolubility of carbon formed in the reaction in the molten
mixture led to C segregation to the top of the reactor where it
could be easily removed. They conducted theoretical modeling
to conclude that the active sites are isolated Ni atoms with a
partial positive charge.
C−H activation on dilute alloys has also received
considerable theoretical interest. A systematic examination of
12 SAA combinations for methane dehydrogenation was
conducted by Stamatakis and co-workers.144 They showed for
C−H activation in CH4 that the activation energies and
binding energies of intermediates on SAAs do not exhibit the
same linear scaling relationships as the pure metals. These
deviations occur due to stabilization of the atop transition state

result in coke formation due to the ability of Cu to perform
C−C coupling, which yields C2 and C3 products as seen in
Figure 27. Furthermore, while Pt ensembles on Cu displayed
the lowest barrier for C−H activation, the adsorbed methyl
groups decomposed to form coke on the surface and release
the hydrogen in the form of methane. The PtCu SAA was
found to have a C−H intermediate activation barrier between
that of pure Cu and a monolayer of Pt on Cu. Furthermore,
the PtCu SAA oﬀers a distinct advantage over extended Pt
because it does not lead to coke formation. Instead, complete
dehydrogenation is prevented by a C−C coupling pathway that
produces ethene and propene rather than further C−H
activation that leads to carbon deposition on the surface.
This result was rationalized by DFT calculations showing that
coke formation is endothermic on PtCu SAAs, while it is
exothermic on Pt surfaces. These results were veriﬁed with
ﬂow reactor work examining C−H activation in butane. PtCu
SAA nanoparticles displayed considerably lower light-oﬀ
temperatures than Cu. Although Pt nanoparticles exhibited
even lower light-oﬀ temperatures compared to the PtCu SAA,
this came at the cost of long-term reactivity due to coking of
the active sites. Unlike pure Pt the PtCu SAA exhibited
prolonged activity for butane dehydrogenation due to the
ability of the Cu host to prevent coke formation.
Sun and co-workers also examined C−H activation on PtCu
SAA nanoparticles for the case of propane conversion to
propene, for which their SAA catalysts showed stable
conversion at temperatures as high as 540 °C.82 However,
due to the increased operational temperatures required for this
diﬃcult conversion, sintering led to catalyst deactivation at
∼600 °C. This was due to sintering of the Cu nanoparticles
themselves (see section 4.1 and 5 for more details). Sun and
co-workers also performed DFT studies of propane dehydrogenation and found that coke formation is endothermic on
PtCu SAAs compared to extended Pt.82 They compared their
calculations to previous work on Pt3M alloys and found that
the PtCu SAA deviates signiﬁcantly from the expected scaling
relationships and coke formation is much less likely than what
would be expected based solely on the initial dehydrogenation
step activity. The group also showed some similar, albeit less

by the dopant atom relative to the ﬁnal state binding of the
intermediate. Considering spillover of CH3 and H species onto
the host metal, the deviations from linear scaling become even
more apparent.15 Jiang and co-workers conducted a screening
study examining the complete methane dehydrogenation
pathway (CH4 → CH3 + H → CH2 + 2H → CH + 3H →
C + 4H) on PdCu, PtCu, RhCu, and NiCu SAAs.193 They
found the reactivity can be ranked as follows: RhCu(111) >
NiCu(111) > PtCu(111) > PdCu(111) > Cu(111), with the
last C−H dissociation step being the most diﬃcult. There have
been two other studies which examined methane activation on
RhCu speciﬁcally.194,195 Kokalj and co-workers found that the
ﬁrst dehydrogenation step is relatively insensitive to ensemble
eﬀects and predicted that the isolated Rh site lowered the ﬁrst
C−H activation barrier almost as much as pure Rh(111), while
the second dehydrogenation step is sensitive to ensemble
eﬀects and is inhibited on the RhCu SAA relative to Rh(111)
making it a promising SAA catalyst. A similar study on RhCu
SAAs for methane dehydrogenation was also conducted by
Zhang and co-workers.195 While these studies predict favorable
properties of RhCu, these theoretical ﬁndings have yet to be
tested experimentally.
Gerrits and co-workers extended this modeling work and
examined the dynamic behavior of methane on PtCu and
PdCu SAAs.196 They found the isolated Pt atom, and to a
lesser extent the Pd atom, catalyze C−H cleavage in methane
through a combination of eﬀects: reduction of the barrier
height, changes to the dynamic pathway, and diﬀerences in
how energy transfers from the reactant to the surface.
Molecules more complex than methane have also been
considered, with Cao and co-workers investigating propane
dehydrogenation on PdCu SAA surfaces, as well as nanoparticles using ﬁrst-principle calculations.197−199 They found
that isolated Pd sites provide a good combination of activity
and selectivity by catalyzing the C−H cleavage without binding
propylene so strongly as to promote side reactions.
Furthermore, they examined the reactive intermediates
considering two potential pathways and simulated vibrational
spectra for key intermediates which could be used to
experimentally distinguish between the various reaction steps
in the reaction. Motivated by the computational demand of
screening vast libraries of SAA for speciﬁc reactions, Takigawa
and co-workers used machine learning methods to predict the

binding strength of key intermediates in methane dehydrogenation.200 Using a set of 12 descriptors, they were able to
predict the properties of 46 Cu based SAAs with good accuracy
by comparing the results to more standard DFT modeling.
Saxena and co-workers took a similar machine learning
approach and examined the binding energies of carbon on a
range of SAAs.201 Clearly, this theoretical work points to the
favorable properties of SAAs for C−H activation; however, in
many cases experimental veriﬁcation is still needed.
Although experimental work examining dehydrogenation of
alkanes on SAAs only began in 2018, the major advantages
appear to be resilience to coke formation and deviations from
linear scaling relationships. This has been experimentally
demonstrated on PtCu SAAs; however, experimental work
beyond this is limited.67,82,144 In the case of PtCu the
prolonged activity relative to Pt comes at the price of initial
activity. However, recent theoretical work has predicted that
Rh based SAAs may be able to maintain the activity of pure Rh
while also displaying prolonged activity, although experimental
veriﬁcation is currently lacking.144,194 Given the current
relevance of light hydrocarbon reactions, this should be a
fruitful area of future SAA research.
3.5. Dehydrogenation of Oxygen Containing
Hydrocarbons (Alcohols and Formic Acid)

The catalytic dehydrogenation of oxygenates, for example
converting alcohols to aldehydes under both oxidative and
nonoxidative conditions, is a useful method for upgrading
small molecules to more valuable products. Under oxidative
conditions, water is produced as a byproduct.202 Furthermore,
recent work has shown that water can also act as a cocatalyst in
the reaction by enabling the O−H cleavage step.203 However,
nonoxidative alcohol reforming, which produces the aldehyde
and hydrogen, is the desired pathway because it produces a
more valuable side product (hydrogen vs water) and also
reduces the need for aldehyde separation from the water
produced in the oxidative reaction.202 Alcohol dehydrogenation has been studied on both Cu and Au based SAAs.64,68
PtCu and PdCu displayed minimal improvement in catalytic
performance over pure Cu; however, NiCu and NiAu SAAs
promoted aldehyde formation without forming the decomposition products associated with extended Ni surfaces.
One of the ﬁrst reports of alcohol dehydrogenation on SAAs
comes from the work of Boucher and co-workers, who

dehydrogenation.205 Their work also demonstrated that
although O−H scission takes place at the Pt site, the resulting
intermediates could spill over to the Cu host.
Furthermore, a considerable increase in activity was
observed for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol on
NiAu SAAs relative to the host material.68 On Au nanoparticles, the apparent activation energy was found to be 96 kJ/
mol, compared to ∼60 kJ/mol on both nanoparticle and
nanoporous NiAu SAAs with minimal reduction in selectivity
up to 280 °C. Therefore, the isolated Ni atom site is able to
activate both the C−H and the O−H bonds required to
convert ethanol into acetaldehyde. At elevated temperature Ni
aggregation was observed leading to C−C cleavage and
decomposition of the ethanol. After reaction at 300 °C CO
DRIFTS conﬁrmed the appearance of a new peak assigned to
CO on small Ni ensembles in Au, which are highly active for
ethanol decomposition. Mullins and co-workers also examined
ethanol dehydrogenation on PdAu model catalysts.206,207 They
found that surfaces with many PdAu interface sites (Pd
monomers) promote selective acetaldehyde production
compared to Pd ensembles. There has also been some
theoretical work examining the oxidative dehydrogenation of
alcohols on PdAu.208 Chang and co-workers reported that
monomer pairs play an important role, and the interaction of
O2 and CH3OH facilitates O2 activation and leads to more
selective product formation.
With respect to theoretical screening work, there have been
studies addressing a variety of SAA combinations for the
elementary steps of alcohol dehydrogenation. Darby and coworkers examined the O−H scission step in methanol
dehydrogenation.144 Although this may be an important step
in the pathway, C−H cleavage must also be considered. A
more complex pathway was considered in the work of
Henkelman and co-workers who examined ethanol dehydrogenation on a wide variety of SAAs.209,210 They found that
SAAs with strongly bound dopants (Ir, Pd, Pt, and Rh) alloyed
into coinage metals (Au, Ag, and Cu) may catalyze the α-C−H
cleavage ﬁrst. Furthermore, they report that the isolated sites
can facilitate hydrogen desorption and prevent coke formation
associated with larger dopant ensembles.
Another relevant reaction is the dehydrogenation of formic
acid (widely considered as a hydrogen storage molecule for
fuel cell applications). There are two common pathways for
HCOOH decomposition invoked: dehydrogenation to CO2
and H2 and dehydration to H2O and CO.211 Since Pt is a
common metal in fuel cells, production of even small amounts
of CO can poison the electrode; hence, high selectivity in
HCOOH decomposition is important.212 Using a combination
of model system studies and nanoparticle catalysis, Marcinkowski and co-workers showed that PtCu SAAs catalyze the
selective decomposition of formic acid to CO2 and H2 without
the production of water or CO, whereas at high Pt coverages
where Pt−Pt bonds are present in the Cu surface CO was
produced. Although the conversions observed in model surface
science studies were 6 times greater than those for Cu,
nanoparticle work showed only a modest increase in reactivity
on PtCu SAA nanoparticles compared to pure Cu (Figure 31).
Like some of the alcohol dehydrogenation studies discussed
above, this is due to isolated Pt sites facilitating the initial O−
H cleavage, which results in the formation of more formate
intermediates on the surface. However, the SAA oﬀers little
beneﬁt for the rate limiting step involving decomposition of
the formate intermediate to CO2 and H2, explaining why

examined methanol dehydrogenation on model PdCu SAA
surfaces as seen in Figure 29.203 They found that isolated Pd
sites stabilized methanol such that a greater yield of
formaldehyde was produced compared to pure Cu. Atomicscale STM imaging revealed that the surface methoxy
intermediates were always surrounded by water molecules.
This suggested that the role of water was to stabilize the H
atom removed from CH3OH during the methoxy formation
step. In support of this, Pan and co-workers calculated that a
single H atom on a metal surface can be stabilized by up to ∼1
eV by coordination with four water molecules.204 However,
because the Pd sites and water only catalyzed O−H cleavage,
they did not result in formaldehyde production at lower
temperatures than on Cu.203 These results are in agreement
with tests on nanoparticles by Shan and co-workers which
showed yields on PdCu to be similar to pure Cu.65 A similar
result was reported by Shan and co-workers on PtCu SAAs
using a combination of model system and nanoparticle studies,
in which they concluded that the PtCu SAAs were more active
than PdCu SAAs.65 Furthermore, both PdCu and PtCu SAA
catalysts required water to be coﬂowed for formaldehyde
production conﬁrming the role of water as a cocatalyst. For the
SAA catalysts, close to 100% selectivity for formaldehyde was
achieved. This is in contrast to high loadings of Pt which
catalyze the unfavorable decomposition of methanol to
CO.65,203
Considerable advances were made by Shan and co-workers,
who found NiCu SAA catalysts to be highly active for the
dehydrogenation of ethanol without the addition of water.64
They found that isolated Ni sites catalyzed the rate
determining C−H cleavage step, resulting in a reduction of
the apparent activation energy from ∼72 kJ/mol on Cu to ∼46
kJ/mol on NiCu SAAs. They examined NiCu in both
nanoparticle and nanoporous form, observing little diﬀerence
in the apparent activation energy. This provides evidence that
under these conditions the reaction is structure insensitive. A
direct comparison of PdCu, PtCu, and NiCu SAAs under
identical conditions is shown in Figure 30. While PdCu and
PtCu show little reduction in the apparent activation energy
relative to Cu, NiCu shows a considerable decrease. This is in
agreement with recent work by Wang and co-workers using
model catalysts and DFT that demonstrated that Pt sites only
have a slight eﬀect on the C−H cleavage step in ethanol

substantially increased rates in the ﬂow reactor studies were
not observed.
Formic acid decomposition on model PdAu surfaces has also
been examined by Mullins and co-workers. They found that
surfaces with Pd monomers favor the dehydrogenation
pathway while PdAu surfaces with Pd(111)-like ensembles
favor production of CO.213 To the best of our knowledge,
these observations have yet to be tested under ﬂow reactor
conditions, but may be promising. There has been less
theoretical screening work on formic acid decomposition on
SAAs speciﬁcally; however, a study by Yoo and co-workers did
consider intermetallic compounds.214 In fact, they point to
Cu3Pt as a promising material. Although Cu3Pt contains
considerably more Pt than most SAA studies, the ideal
structure of this material is SAA-like, exhibiting only isolated Pt
sites surrounded by Cu.51−53
To summarize, dehydrogenation of oxygenates is an
industrially important class of reactions. As this often involves
a two-step reaction mechanism, catalyzing both the O−H and
C−H steps is important. While some SAAs, such as PtCu for
ethanol dehydrogenation, catalyze the O−H cleavage, if this is
not the rate-determining step, the SAA shows little beneﬁt
under ﬂow reactor conditions. The best SAAs to date for these
reactions are Ni based and show considerable activity for C−H
and O−H cleavage.64,68 In order to further this oxygenate
dehydrogenation work, a clear understanding of what the rate
limiting steps are and how diﬀerent SAAs change them is
needed. This is where theoretical work informed by surface
science and ﬂow reactor results may serve as an informative
guide in identifying the most active SAA combinations to
examine experimentally.

more economically valuable products.166 Many of these
reactions are often performed with homogeneous catalysts
that often involve the use of toxic chemicals.215 Recently, there
has been signiﬁcant interest in developing single-site
heterogeneous catalysts for these reactions to aid in
product−catalyst separation.216 Due to the well-deﬁned nature
of the single metal atom active site in SAAs, researchers have
been interested in using these catalysts to bridge the structural
complexity gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous
catalysts.4,5 Recently, reports of Ullman and Wurtz style
coupling on PdAu SAAs and oxidative cross coupling on NiAu
SAAs have appeared in the literature which we will review
below.69,217,218 We also cover an early report of vinyl acetate
synthesis on PdAu model catalysts.219
Ullmann type coupling is the reaction between two aryl
halides to form an aryl−aryl bond and has been historically
performed using copper.220 Work by Zhang and co-workers
has shown that small amounts of Pd in Au can be highly active
for the type of reaction.217 Examining chlorobenzene coupling,
they found that the turnover number initially increases
exponentially with an increasing Au/Pd ratio as seen in Figure
32. Counterintuitively, the reaction selectivity is maximized at
a Au/Pd ratio of 6/1 and then decreases at higher Au/Pd
ratios. For the most selective catalyst, they examined a variety
of other Ullman style coupling reactions, varying the halide as
well as functionalities on the phenyl group. In terms of
stability, they found that the catalyst could be reused at least 8
times by simply ﬁlter separating and drying of the catalyst
under vacuum between uses.
Wurtz coupling is the reaction between alkyl halides to form
the corresponding alkane.221 Recently, work by Réocreux and
co-workers has shown PdAu model SAA surfaces catalyze both
the C−I cleavage and the subsequent C−C coupling steps to
form ethane from methyl iodide.218 As seen in Figure 33 the
Au surface displays poor activity for this reaction with C−I
cleavage requiring exposures of methyl iodide at elevated

temperatures and C−C coupling not occurring until 300 K.
The PdAu SAA surfaces catalyze both the C−I cleavage as well
as the C−C coupling, evolving ethane at 250 K, as shown
schematically. In stark contrast to the SAA, higher coverages of
Pd show no activity for C−C coupling but instead lead to the
decomposition of the methyl iodide via C−H activation
pathways.
Vinyl acetate is an important chemical feedstock used in the
production of polymers. Early work by Chen and co-workers
examined this reaction on PdAu(111) and PdAu(100) model
surfaces.219 They found that both surface facets contained
isolated Pd sites at low Pd coverage and that the spacing
between the isolated Pd sites was important in the reaction. As
shown in Figure 34, exposure of the surfaces to a mixture of
acetic acid, ethylene, and oxygen results in the formation of
vinyl acetate. Interestingly, the turnover frequency is much
higher on the Au(100) surface. This eﬀect was explained by
considering the coupling of ethylene to acetylene, an essential
step in the mechanism. They explained their activity results in

Figure 34. Vinyl acetate (VA) formation rates (turnover frequencies
(TOFs)) as a function of Pd coverage on Au(100) and Au(111). The
VA synthesis was carried out at 453 K, with acetic acid, ethylene, and

terms of Pd−Pd distances. The optimum Pd−Pd distance for
coupling surface ethylenic and acetate species is ∼0.33 nm
which is closer to the spacing of Pd monomers (0.408 nm) in
the Au(100) surface compared to in the Au(111) surface
(0.499 nm) as shown schematically in Figure 34. In a related
theoretical work, Zhang and co-workers found that isolated Pd
atoms in Au(100) could catalyze C−H cleavage in ethylene
without considerable C−C cleavage (which leads to coke
formation).222

and oxidative based coupling reactions to understand the
mechanisms and predict the most active SAA combinations
have yet to be undertaken but constitute a signiﬁcant
opportunity to improve upon current coupling methods.

Oxidative cross coupling of alcohols involves the reaction of
an aldehyde with an alcohol to form higher oxygenates. These
reactions are generally run under oxidative conditions as
surface oxygen is necessary for the production of the reactive
intermediates, as established by signiﬁcant work on Au based
surfaces by the Friend and Madix groups.223−225 More
recently, Trimpalis and co-workers examined NiAu SAAs for
the oxidative coupling of methanol and methacrolein to form
methyl methacrylate in the liquid phase.69 They found that the
NiAu SAA had much higher conversions of methacrolein
compared to Au and maintained high selectivity to methyl
methacrylate. Kinetic studies revealed that the apparent
activation energies of the Au and NiAu samples are similar,
leading the authors to conclude that the active site involves the
Au−Ox species. Furthermore, unlike on Au, where selectivity is
highly sensitive to the ratio of methanol and methacrolein in
the reaction mixture, for the NiAu SAA the selectivity to
methyl methacrylate is essentially constant from 0.1 to 0.94
mole fraction methanol as seen in Figure 35. In this reaction,
the authors propose that the role of the isolated Ni species is 3fold and results in (1) preservation of activity at high
methacrolein methanol ratios due to preferential binding of
methanol over methacrylate, (2) stabilization of the reaction
intermediate via the basic nature of Ni−Ox, and (3) increase of
the amount of Au−Ox active sites.
Compared to the vast range of homogeneous coupling
reactions known to synthetic organic chemists,221 only a few
SAAs have so far been investigated for these reactions. We
envision that the well-deﬁned active sites inherent to SAAs
may result in more selective chemistry than traditional
heterogeneous catalysts. To date, the limited experimental
work on organohalides suggests that isolated sites in SAAs may
lower the activation energy for both carbon−halide cleavage
and subsequent C−C coupling. Additionally, little work on
SAAs has investigated oxidative coupling conditions. Trimpalis
and co-workers have shown that isolated Ni sites clearly serve
multiple roles in the coupling reaction.69 The Ni sites aid in O2
dissociation and oxygen transfer to the Au, but the exact
mechanism remains unclear. Unlike hydrogenation and
dehydrogenation reactions, systematic studies of organohalide

3.7. Other Thermal Reactions

In addition to the reactions discussed above, SAAs have been
studied for many other types of reactions. These include
ammonia borane dehydrogenation, automotive catalysis (NO
reduction and CO oxidation), benzonitrile hydrogenation,
CO2 and CO upgrading, dechlorination, dimethyl oxalate
synthesis, glucose oxidation, hydrogen peroxide synthesis,
hydrosilylation, methane oxidation, oxygen activation, SO3
decomposition, and the water−gas-shift reaction. While the
SAA literature on many of these reactions is sparse, the wide
range of reactions discussed below demonstrate the applicability of SAAs in many diﬀerent chemical processes.
3.7.1. Ammonia Borane Dehydrogenation for Hydrogen Storage. Ammonia borane has gained attention as a
promising hydrogen storage molecule for fuel cell applications.
The reaction used to produce H2 can be summarized as
follows: NH3BH3 + 2H2O → NH4BO2 + 3H2.226 Li and coworkers examined this reaction in aqueous phase using PtNi
SAA catalysts, ﬁnding the turnover frequency on the SAA
catalyst to be ∼21 times higher than other Pt based
catalysts.227 Their theoretical work indicated that there is
charge transfer in the PtNi SAA with Ni bearing a partial
positive charge and Pt bearing a negative charge. This results in
H adsorption on the Pt site and OH adsorption on the Ni site
after water dissociation. Further reaction with NH3BH3 results
in the formation of Ni−H and H3NH2B−OH species.
Hydrogen recombination results from recombination of a
Ni−H and Pt−H, displaying a synergistic eﬀect between Ni
and Pt.
3.7.2. Automotive Catalysis (NO Reduction and CO
Oxidation). Automotive catalytic converter type chemistry
involving the reduction of NO by CO on PdCu SAAs was
recently studied by Furukawa and co-workers.83 Aluminasupported PdCu SAA nanoparticles yielded high selectivity to
N2 production while achieving complete conversion at
intermediate temperatures (175 °C) and retaining stable

prevents the formation of toluene, a toxic byproduct. The
authors rationalized this result based on the relative ordering of
the hydrogenation barriers. On Pd(111), the second hydrogenation step is easier than the ﬁrst, which prevents the
accumulation of the key intermediate necessary for coupling to
form dibenzylamine. On the PdNi SAA, the second hydrogenation step is much more diﬃcult than the ﬁrst, resulting in
accumulation of the key intermediate, which can form
dibenzylamine and not overhydrogenate to toluene. These
results open a path for the use of this type of SAA catalyst in
the ﬁne chemical industry where amines are commonplace.
3.7.4. Carbon Dioxide and Carbon Monoxide
Upgrading. Chemical upgrading of CO2 and CO to more
valuable hydrocarbons is a desirable reaction from an
environmental perspective.238 There have been only a few
experimental reports examining CO2 hydrogenation on SAAs.
The ﬁrst by Mori and co-workers examined CO2 hydrogenation to formic acid on PdAg SAAs. They found that at
intermediate pressure (20 bar) and low temperature (100 °C),
the TiO2-supported PdAg SAA oﬀered a 10-fold increase in the
catalytic activity toward the selective formation of formic acid
compared to monometallic Pd nanoparticles.239 Using DFT
they found that the SAA surface structure promotes the ratedetermining step, hydrogenation of the HCO3− intermediate.
The authors point to a strong correlation between activity and
decreased electron density on Pd. In a related work, Kikkawa
and co-workers examined CO2 hydrogenation on alumina
supported PtNi SAAs.240 While extended Pt surfaces favored
CO production, the isolated Pt species in Ni favored CH4
production from CO2 and H2 at 250 °C. Furthermore, they
found that isolated Pt sites promoted H2 dissociation as well as
strong binding of CO, leading to a weakening of the C−O
bond thus promoting hydrogenation.
There has also been considerable theoretical work in this
area. Zhao and co-workers examined the relative rates of
hydrogenation of CHx intermediates vs CO insertion, an
important step in the synthesis of C2 oxygenates.241 Using a
combination of DFT and microkinetic modeling, they
discovered that while pure Rh surfaces favor hydrogenation
of CH2 over CO insertion, the RhCu SAA favors CO insertion
leading to C2 oxygenates. Moving beyond this work, Gao and
co-workers conducted a similar study on RhCu(111) and
RhCu(100).242 Unlike Zhao and co-workers, Gao and co-

performance over the course of 30 h on stream. The isolated
Pd atoms aid in the rate-determining step, that of N−O
dissociation in the (NO)2 dimer, while the host metal surface
facilitates the N2O decomposition, maintaining high selectivity
to N2. The results of kinetic studies along with theoretical
modeling are shown in Figure 36. There has also been
theoretical interest in NO dissociation on SAAs, with Illas and
co-workers examining RhCu and CuRh SAAs, and Kitchin and
Thirumalai examining PdCu, PdAg, and PdAu.160,228,229
However, these studies examine the direct decomposition of
NO to N* and O* and do not consider the decomposition of
the (NO)2 dimer, which may play an important role as
suggested by Furukawa.83
There has also been considerable work examining CO
oxidation on PdAu nanoparticles and model catalysts. In an
early report, Gao and co-workers showed that continuous Pd
sites were required for CO oxidation at low temperature.230
They conducted experiments using a AuPd(100) model
catalyst which they could prepare to expose isolated Pd
atoms surrounded by Au or contiguous Pd atoms surrounded
by Au. They found that contiguous Pd sites are required for O2
dissociation (for more discussion on O2 dissociation see
section 3.7.11). Interestingly, they also found that CO
oxidation starts to occur around 160 K, which is well below
what was observed for pure Pd, showing a clear synergistic
eﬀect between Au and Pd. This has been generally supported
by other experimental and theoretical studies which point to
the beneﬁcial role of Pd ensembles in Au for CO
oxidation.231−234 In a more recent study, Luneau and coworkers examined CO oxidation on PdAu nanoparticles
stabilized in a colloid templated porous SiO2 support.235
They suggested that isolated Pd sites in Au are capable of CO
oxidation, albeit with a slightly higher barrier than catalysts
with higher Pd loadings in which small ensembles are present.
3.7.3. Benzonitrile Hydrogenation. The hydrogenation
of nitriles is an important industrial process.236 The beneﬁcial
eﬀect of dilute metal doping for this reaction was demonstrated
for a PdNi SAA in the hydrogenation of benzonitrile to
dibenzylamine, by combining reactor and theoretical studies.237 The surface alloy caused a signiﬁcant boost in the
catalytic yield from 5 to ∼97% at 6 bar and 80 °C, as shown
over consecutive batch reaction runs. The main advantage of
the process on PdNi is the high selectivity and stability, which

of hydrogen peroxide. Despite this, it is worth noting that they
observed the highest selectivity at intermediate Pd:Au ratios.
They suggested that at higher Au loadings, the formation of
Au/TiO2 interface sites promotes the formation of water which
reduces the selectivity. This could perhaps be alleviated by
choosing a less reactive support material. These results are
supported by other theoretical studies which examined the role
of Pd ensemble size, ﬁnding that Pd monomers inhibit O−O
scission which can be associated with loss of selectivity for
hydrogen peroxide.255,256 Similar results pointing out the
beneﬁcial role of metal monomers in hydrogen peroxide
synthesis have also been shown for PtAg, PdAg, and PdSn
alloys.257−259 For a more detailed discussion of oxygen
activation on SAAs see section 3.7.11.
3.7.9. Hydrosilylation. The hydrosilylation of unsaturated
ketones and alkynes is an important synthetic route for the
addition of Si and H over an unsaturated bond.260 Miura and
co-workers examined various PdAu alloys for the hydrosilylation of a range of unsaturated ketones and alkynes via
HSiR3 to yield the corresponding silyl enol ethers and vinyl
silane.261 They examined both pure Au and Pd, which were
ineﬀective for the reaction while PdAu SAA nanoparticles
catalyze the reaction under mild conditions. In fact, they found
that the dilute PdAu samples with isolated Pd sites had the
highest turnover frequency, which lead them to conclude that
the isolated sites were responsible for the remarkable
properties (Figure 37).

workers also examined the formation of methanol in addition
to ethanol. They suggested that RhCu(100) favors ethanol
synthesis over RhCu(111). Furthermore, they note that the
isolated Rh site can promote the C−C coupling step leading to
longer chain alcohols. Yang and co-workers examined a variety
of Cu based SAAs with DFT and KMC for CO2 hydrogenation
to methanol.243 They found that the ideal catalyst exhibited
facile dioxomethylene hydrogenation and intermediate CO
binding strength, resulting in increased methanol yield in the
following order: AuCu(111) < Cu(111) < PdCu(111) <
RhCu(111) < PtCu(111) < NiCu(111).243 Considerable work
has also been done by Wang and co-workers, who examined a
variety of bimetallic surfaces including RhCu(211),
CoCu(211), and MnCu(211) for syngas upgrading.244−246
All of these studies point to the beneﬁcial role of the dopant
atom, and clearly more experimental research is needed in this
area to verify these claims and identify new SAA catalysts.
3.7.5. Dechlorination. Removal of halides such as Cl from
small alkyl halides is of interest in environmental applications
such as the dechlorination of chlorinated hydrocarbons to
reduce their toxicity.247 Work by Ball and co-workers
investigated the hydrodechlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane
on PdAg alloys supported on TiO2, SiO2, and carbon
supports.77 Atomic dispersion of Pd atoms was demonstrated
on the titania-supported alloys, and the catalysts exhibited high
selectivity for ethylene (∼97%). In contrast, the presence of
extended Pd ensembles favored total hydrogenation to ethane
and resulted in lower selectivity (∼91%).
3.7.6. Dimethyl Oxalate Synthesis. Dimethyl oxalate is a
valuable feedstock chemical used in the production of ethylene
glycol.248 Han and co-workers examined the synthesis of
dimethyl oxalate via a theoretical approach on a PdAg SAA.249
Using a combination of microkinetic modeling and DFT, they
examined the following reaction pathway: CO + CH3O →
COOCH3 + CO + OCH3 → 2COOCH3 → (CH3O2C)2.
They found the last step, 2COOCH3 → (CH3O2C)2, to be
rate determining. When compared to other dilute alloy
surfaces, the PdAg SAA comprised of isolated Pd atoms in
an Ag host provided the highest selectivity for dimethyl
oxalate, prompting the authors to conclude that this system
warrants experimental examination. The authors rationalize the
favorable catalytic properties based on strain and ligand eﬀects
present in the SAA.
3.7.7. Glucose Oxidation. Toshima and co-workers
examined glucose oxidation on AuPd SAAs.250−252 These
catalysts are opposite to most SAAs in that they consist of
isolated Au atoms at the vertices of a Pd nanoparticle. They
demonstrated isolated Au sites lead to activity values 17−40
times higher than those for Pd and Au clusters of the same size
and 5−8 times greater than those for other AuPd alloys. The
authors concluded that the charge transfer between the
isolated Au atoms and the Pd atoms is important for the
improved reactivity.
3.7.8. Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis. The direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from hydrogen and oxygen
remains a challenging reaction to date. This is because it is
often more favorable to form water, either from the direct
reaction of hydrogen and oxygen or via the hydrogenation of
hydrogen peroxide.253 Ouyang and co-workers examined the
direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide on a variety of PdAu
SAA nanoparticles supported on TiO2.254 In their paper, they
suggest that isolated Pd atoms in gold are capable of hydrogen
peroxide synthesis and also inhibit subsequent hydrogenation

3.7.10. Methane Oxidation. The partial oxidation of
methane represents an important industrial route for the
production of synthesis gas.262 In an early report, Besenbacher
and co-workers conducted STM experiments to show that low
coverages of Au atoms exist as isolated sites in the Ni(111)
surface.263 They leveraged this observation to design high
surface area nanoparticle analogs which showed dramatically
improved catalytic properties for methane oxidation in steam
reforming due to the suppression of coke formation by Au.264
In two recent theoretical reports by Li and co-workers, the
partial oxidation of methane on PtCu and PdCu SAAs was
examined.265,266 With respect to PdCu, they examined two

H2O while leaving the C−O bond intact, resulting in high
selectivity and performance in the water−gas-shift reaction.
Furthermore, related work by Kitchin and Thirumalai screened
some additional SAAs for H2O dissociation, ﬁnding that PdAg
and PdAu show enhanced binding strengths for the dissociated
intermediates relative to the base metal, while PdCu does
not.160 Furthermore, the authors comment that due to the high
recombination barriers imposed by the strong binding, these
catalysts may be active for reactions which aim to utilize the
adsorbed intermediates.

structures: Pd adsorbed on Cu(111) and Pd alloyed into
Cu(111). They found that the adsorbed Pd atoms are prone to
agglomeration in contrast to the alloyed Pd. On the alloyed
PdCu surface, they found that the partial oxidation of methane
occurs via the following pathway: CH4 → CH3 → CH3O →
CH2O → CHO → CO with the ﬁrst C−H cleavage being the
rate-determining step. In their second report they examined
PtCu SAAs, in which they focused more on the coke resistant
properties of PtCu. Comparing the PtCu SAA to a PtNi SAA
(Ni is the commercial catalyst for methane steam reforming),
they found that the PtCu SAA was much more coke resistant
than the PtNi SAA.
3.7.11. Oxygen Activation. O2 dissociation is a key step
in many industrial oxidations.267 To date, most of the work on
SAAs in this area has focused on PdAu alloys. It is generally
accepted that oxygen dissociation is not possible on Pd
monomers and that Pd ensembles facilitate the reaction.230,233,234,254 Recent theoretical work has shown that
pairs of isolated Pd atoms may facilitate oxygen cleavage on the
PdAu(100) surface.233 In an attempt to examine a wide range
of SAA combinations, Saxena and co-workers examined the
binding strength of oxygen on a variety of SAAs with a
machine learning based approach.201 As oxygen dissociation is
often considered as part of reactions such as CO oxidation and
hydrogen peroxide synthesis, the interested reader is pointed
to those sections of this review for more details (see sections
3.7.2 and 3.7.8).
Lucci and co-workers studied the oxidation of Au in PdAu
model SAAs via ozone exposure.268 They found that exposure
of ozone to gold led to the formation of a more ordered oxide,
while a disordered oxide was formed on the PdAu SAA.
Furthermore, the desorption of oxygen from the PdAu surface
occurred at a lower temperature compared to Au due to the
disorder of the minority Pd sites introduced into the oxide
covering the Au surface. Recent work by Schweinar and coworkers examined the structure of dilute CuAg alloys after
oxygen exposure.269 They found that oxygen treatment leads to
formation of a thin 2D copper oxide ﬁlm, structurally similar to
Cu2O, with distinct electronic properties due to the inﬂuence
of the underlying noble metal.
3.7.12. SO3 Decomposition. SO3 decomposition is an
important step in the sulfur−iodine cycle used to produce
hydrogen.270 Theoretical work by Majumder and Nigam has
demonstrated that isolated Ag atoms in Pt may help facilitate
this step.271 They found that the isolated Ag site promotes S−
O bond cleavage and weakens binding to SO2, the reaction
product. These eﬀects were rationalized based on the
electronic structure of the isolated Ag site. Furthermore, they
found that the AgPt9 cluster interacted more strongly with the
support than Pt10 clusters, indicating that the SAA cluster
should be more resistant to sintering.
3.7.13. Water−Gas Shift Reaction. The water−gas shift
reaction is an important industrial process which converts CO
and H2O to CO2 and H2.272 Recently the importance of
isolated metal species on oxides has received considerable
examination for this reaction.6,273−275 Despite the interest in
single atoms on oxides, much less focus has been placed on
SAAs for this reaction. A theoretical study by the Gan group
computed the Ni ensemble size in a NiCu alloy for optimal
water−gas-shift activity.276 Through extensive screening of
diﬀerent surface compositions it was determined that Ni
dimers or trimers promote CO dissociation and as such lower
the selectivity. On the contrary, dispersed Ni atoms activate

3.8. Nonthermal Catalysis

Nonthermal catalysis refers to reactions that are driven by a
nonthermal external energy input. Examples include photocatalysis, plasmonic catalysis, and electrocatalysis. Recently, the
beneﬁts of SAAs, which are well established in thermal
catalysis, have been demonstrated in these ﬁelds. In the
following sections we review these relatively recent developments.
3.8.1. Plasmonic and Photocatalysis. There has been a
growing interest in exploiting the plasmonic properties of
nanomaterials to drive challenging reactions.277 However, only
in the past few years have researchers examined SAAs under
these conditions. Recently, Zhou and co-workers reported that
RuCu SAAs facilitate CH4 reforming with CO2 to create
syngas (CO and H2). The particles were both more active and
more selective under illumination by white light compared to
thermal catalysis as seen in Figure 38. Based on their

thermocatalysis at 1,000 K (red circles). Feed gases consisted of 8
sccm CH4 and 8 sccm CO2 for all experiments. Inset shows a

theoretical work, they attribute this behavior to photogenerated hot carriers promoting C−H activation. The
presence of isolated Ru sites also prevented coke formation
and the reverse-water gas shift reaction, which would occur at
higher Ru loadings at which ensembles are present.17 In
another study involving CO2, Long and co-workers prepared
titania-supported Pd nanoparticles doped with isolated Cu
atoms for the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to CH4.278
They found these particles to be highly selective for CH4
(96%). They propose the d-band center of the Cu atom is
raised by being isolated in Pd, and the strong binding of the
CO2 to the Pd−Cu sites aids in the reaction. Finally, Han and
AD

been some interest in examining the electrochemical synthesis
of hydrogen peroxide on PdAu alloys.288
Electrochemical formic acid oxidation has also been
examined on SAAs. Duchesne and co-workers reported PtAu
SAAs are highly active for formic acid decomposition.289 They
found that while the PtAu SAA favors the desired dehydrogenation pathway, larger Pt ensembles favor dehydration. The
dehydration pathway is a major issue as it leads to CO
production which can poison the active Pt sites. This is in
agreement with experiments by Yang and Lee, who examined
Pt deposited on Au nanoparticles, ﬁnding that low coverages of
Pt favored the dehydrogenation mechanisms while high
coverages resulted in dehydration.290 Yang and Lee also
examined methanol oxidation, ﬁnding that Pt monomers were
unable to catalyze the reaction. Moving beyond coinage metals,
Zhang and co-workers synthesized ultraﬁne RuPt nanodendrites, in which isolated Ru atoms decorate the nanodendrites.291 The RuPt SAAs were tested for methanol
oxidation against commercial PtRu/C, commercial Pt/C, and
also pure-Pt nanodendrites and outperformed all these
materials in terms of both activity and stability.
Finally, we cover theoretical screening work on SAA
electrocatalysis. Cheng and co-workers presented an exhaustive
theoretical screening of SAAs for the electrocatalytic selective
reduction of CO2 to C1 hydrocarbons.292 The authors analyzed
28 SAA pairs, with Au and Ag (111) or (100) host surfaces
doped with a catalytically active dopant metal (Cu, Ni, Pd, Pt,
Co, Rh, Ir). Initial reduction of CO2 to CO is thought to occur
on the host metal, while CO binds to the dopant metal atom.
Selectivity of the catalysts was determined by their capability to
facilitate CO reduction instead of the hydrogen evolution
reaction, with the relative stability of the *COOH or *OCHO
vs *H intermediates playing an important role. Optimal
performance was predicted for surfaces doped with Co, Rh, or
Ir and more extensive reaction pathways were analyzed for the
most promising candidate materials, RhAu(100) and
RhAg(100). Work by Zhao and Lu extended this approach
to Cu based SAAs, examining a wide range of dopants.293 They
pointed to CoCu being a promising candidate for CO2
reduction to methanol due to the isolated nature of the Co
yielding electronic states that result in strong binding which
favors hydrogenation. However, synthesis of CoCu may be
challenging as depositing Co on Cu tends to result in Co

co-workers studied isolated Pt atoms supported in Te
nanowires as catalysts for the plasmon-enhanced dehydrogenation of formic acid.279 They found that illumination increased
the rate of reaction substantially and the mechanism was
identiﬁed to occur via a plasmonic hot-electron driven
mechanism rather than a photothermal one. Speciﬁcally, the
hot electrons generated by the nanowires facilitated the ratedetermining step, decomposition of HCOO*.
3.8.2. Electrocatalysis. SAAs have also expanded into the
ﬁeld of electrocatalysis, where they have been examined for
reactions such as CO oxidation, oxygen reduction reaction,
hydrogen evolution reaction, hydrogen peroxide synthesis,
formic acid oxidation, methanol oxidation, and CO2 reduction.
One of the ﬁrst reports came from Behm and co-workers, who
examined various ensembles of Pd in Au for CO oxidation
using a combination of cyclic voltammetry and in situ STM.55
They found that Pd monomers were all that was required to
promote CO oxidation. Using in situ STM, they were also able
to image the SAA surface under the reaction environment at
the atomic-scale (see section 2.2 Figure 6).
There has also been a great deal of interest in SAAs for
electrochemical reactions involving oxygen and hydrogen.
Typically these reactions are catalyzed with platinum group
metal nanoparticles with Pt often being considered state of the
art.280 In order to move away from these expensive metals,
considerable research has been conducted on a variety of
alloys,281−284 and here we focus exclusively on SAAs. Slanac
and co-workers examined PdAg alloys for the reduction of
oxygen in alkaline solutions, ﬁnding that the dilute PdAg phase
displayed the highest activity.285 Chen and co-workers
examined hydrogen evolution in alkali media using AuRu
SAAs which outperformed a commercial Pt/C catalyst. They
used in situ laser ablation to synthesize these particles as Au
and Ru are bulk immiscible.286 The beneﬁcial bifunctionality of
the AuRu SAA catalyst can be summarized as follows: the
positively charged Ru atoms facilitate H2O adsorption and
dissociation, while the neighboring Au atoms act as binding
sites for H and subsequently as the site for H2 desorption. As a
result, AuRu SAAs are active and stable catalysts due to the
synergy between the Ru and Au sites. Zhang and co-workers
prepared PtPd SAAs which outperformed a commercial Pt/C
catalyst for both the hydrogen evolution reaction and the
oxygen reduction reactions seen in Figure 39.287 There has also

nanoparticle formation as opposed to alloying.294 Recently
there has been interest in using host metals other than Cu, Ag,
and Au. Li and co-workers examined Ru(0001) doped with Fe,
Co, Ni, Cu, Ir, and Pt for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol.295
They found the rate-determining steps in the most desirable
pathways to be *H2COOH and *HCOO formation.
CoRu(0001) and PtRu(0001) appear to be the most favorable
candidates for this reaction based on their calculations.
While electrocatalysis and photocatalysis with SAAs are still
in their infancy, the studies summarized above indicate the
promising nature of SAAs in multiple ﬁelds of catalysis. These
approaches are particularly well equipped to deal with
reactions that are challenging under thermal conditions. We
suggest that the ability of SAAs to oﬀer lower activation energy
barriers while weakly binding reaction intermediates, as
demonstrated for thermal catalysis, will be beneﬁcial in areas
like electro- and photocatalysis as well.

4. GENERAL PROPERTIES OF SINGLE-ATOM ALLOYS
In the following sections, we will explore some of the general
properties that are common to many SAA catalysts and should
be generalizable. These include enhanced reactivity over the
host metal without compromising product selectivity, resistance to deactivation by coke formation, tolerance to CO
poisoning, spillover of reaction intermediates that leads to
bifunctionality, unique electronic structures, and deviations
from linear scaling relationships. We will ﬁrst address the
improved selectivity and stability, focusing on how this can be
understood fundamentally. We then examine spillover pathways which can lead to bifunctionality before concluding with
the unique electronic structure of many of these SAA catalysts
and how they deviate from linear scaling relationships that
limit catalytic performance.

As we have discussed in this review, SAAs are generally
comprised of highly selective host metals such as Cu, Ag, or Au
doped with individual atoms of a reactive metal such as Pd, Pt,
Rh, Ru, or Ni. While the reactive metals themselves often fall
near the top of the Volcano plot for many reactions, they still
suﬀer from issues such as low selectivity and catalyst
deactivation. This is because, in addition to activating
reactants, these reactive metals promote unfavorable steps
such as C−C bond activation, which leads to side products,
and they bind C strongly, which often results in coking. Many
SAAs do not suﬀer from this deactivation pathway because the
atomic dispersion of the active elements generally prevents
reactions such as C−C bond scission that lead to coke
formation. This allows the reactive dopant to perform selective
chemical reactions without deactivating due to decomposition
of the reactants. Moreover, the positions of the transition state
and ﬁnal state for a bond breaking step are often separated
spatially on SAAs, which can lead to both low activation
barriers and weak binding of reaction intermediates.144 These
are two important requirements for selective chemistry to
occur.
Isolating the reactive dopant in a more inert host also has
electronic structure implications that aﬀect reactivity. For most
SAAs, ligand and ensemble eﬀects induced by substituting a
host metal atom with a reactive dopant atom lead to
considerably weaker binding of adsorbates to the dopant
metal. For example, CO desorbs from PdCu at 270 K, vs ∼500
K for pure Pd(111).147 Many of these eﬀects have been
discussed in terms of strain, but this cannot account for all
observations such as the near identical desorption temperatures of CO from PdCu (270 K) and PdAu (260 K) despite
the lattice diﬀerence of Cu (0.256 nm) and Au (0.288
nm).147,149,299 In fact many SAAs display CO tolerance due to
weaker binding of CO to isolated sites compared to the pure
dopant metal.35 This leads to favorable properties as
demonstrated by Liu and co-workers, who showed HD
scrambling was shut down in the presence of CO on Pt
nanoparticles but continued on PtCu SAA nanoparticles
(Figure 40).63 This work was also extended to show the CO

4.1. Selectivity and Catalytic Stability

A general concept in the ﬁeld of single-site catalysis is that high
reaction selectivity can be achieved by virtue of there being
only one type of active site, and hence one favored reaction
pathway. This is unlike many traditional heterogeneous
catalysts which expose an array of active sites on the metal
nanoparticles which can catalyze undesirable side reactions.4,5
SAAs also beneﬁt from this single site eﬀect in that the dopant
metal site generally dominates the reactivity as compared to
less active step edges or kink defects present on the more inert
host metal nanoparticles. As such SAA catalysts have shown
remarkably high selectivity to desirable products as well as
resistance to deactivation for a variety of reactions as described
in this review. More fundamentally, these properties are the
result of a combination of ligand and ensemble eﬀects as well
as the bifunctionality of many SAAs. Ligand eﬀects refer to
changes in the electronic structure of metals due to alloying
while ensemble eﬀects refer to changes in the number of atoms
making up an active site.296 Some recent theory papers address
these eﬀects speciﬁcally for SAAs, and some of the properties
of SAA catalysts can be understood by considering these
eﬀects.297 It is well-known that the best catalysts tend to bind
molecules with an intermediate strength that is strong enough
to activate the desired bonds yet weak enough to desorb the
desired products without further reaction to undesirable
products. This is the basis of the 100-year-old Sabatier
principle and gives rise to volcano plots with the metals
exhibiting the best catalytic performance, located at the top of
the volcano.298

tolerance of the PtCu SAA catalysts for the selective
hydrogenation of acetylene to ethene reaction.
Unlike many single-site catalysts, SAAs display remarkable
thermal stability. This is because for many SAA combinations,
isolated single atom sites are the thermodynamically preferred
phase relative to ensembles.35 This overcomes a signiﬁcant
issue in the ﬁeld of single-site catalysts, in which sintering of
the single atom sites into ensembles is a major problem.300 For
instance, Sun and co-workers observed remarkable stability of
PtCu SAAs for propane dehydrogenation at 520 °C for 120 h
on steam.82 Post reaction catalyst characterization revealed
that the Pt sites remained isolated after reaction under these
relatively harsh conditions. Interestingly, when Sun and coworkers heated the catalyst to 600 °C, they observed sintering
of the Cu host nanoparticles themselves which resulted in
catalyst deactivation. Importantly, HAADF-STEM images
showed that the Pt in the sintered Cu particles was still
present as isolated metal atom sites. This illustrates that a
current limitation of SAAs is the stability of the nanoparticles
themselves rather than the isolated sites, i.e. the sintering of the
Cu host nanoparticles, not aggregation of the isolated Pt
atoms, leads to deactivation at high temperatures. To address
this issue, methods for stabilizing the host nanoparticles against
sintering may be employed such as stabilization in a porous
SiO2 matrix.162,163,235

4.2. Spillover and Bifunctionality

Bifunctional catalysts are of great interest due to their capacity
to deviate from linear scaling relationships that can impose
limits on catalyst performance by virtue of having diﬀerent
reaction steps occur at diﬀerent sites.14,15,136 SAAs are good
candidates for bifunctional chemistry as they have two very
distinct sites; the strongly binding dopant atom and the weakly
binding host. Early work by Tierney and co-workers examined
hydrogen spillover on PdCu SAAs, ﬁnding that H2 activation
was facile on individual, isolated Pd atom sites and that the H
atoms spilled over to weaker binding Cu sites.146 Sykes and coworkers then probed the eﬀect of spillover on reactivity by
examining the hydrogenation of styrene and acetylene on
PdCu SAAs.21,146 They found that the Pd sites facilitated the
dissociation of hydrogen, which then spilled over to the Cu.
When they exposed these hydrogen precovered surfaces to
alkenes and alkynes, they observed selective hydrogenation
chemistries. The hydrogen is supplied by the Pd but spills over
to the Cu where selective hydrogenation can occur via a
bifunctional mechanism. A more recent example is given in
Figure 41, where H atoms have spilled over from Pt sites to
Cu.63 The H atoms appear in STM images as depressions
which can be swept away by imaging at 200 mV. The
remaining depressions are CO molecules, which can be
removed with 5 V pulses. This conclusively shows that the
individual Pt atoms are preferred sites for CO adsorption and
that H occupies the Cu surface. Unlike PdCu and PtCu SAAs
where H atom spillover was spontaneous, in model studies on
PdAu SAAs, H spillover from Pd to Au did not occur until the
surface was exposed to CO (or hexyne) which bound
preferentially to the Pd atoms inducing hydrogen spillover to
Au.71,141,149,299 For more information on spillover in hydrogenation reactions, the reader is pointed to sections 3.1, 3.2,
and 3.3.
To further understand these types of bifunctional reaction
mechanisms, Sykes and co-workers conducted experiments on
the hydrogenation of butadiene to butene on PtCu SAAs as

reactivity.147,148 The molecular cork eﬀect operates as follows:
when hydrogen is exposed to clean PtCu SAAs, the hydrogen
desorbs around 230 K. However, if after hydrogen adsorption
the ∼1% Pt sites are selectively titrated by CO (as seen in
Figure 41), the hydrogen will desorb ~55 K hotter due to the
large recombination barrier for hydrogen on Cu and the
blocking of the Pt sites by CO. In that sense the CO acts as a
molecular cork, keeping hydrogen on the surface beyond its
normal desorption temperature. This eﬀect can also be used to
selectively block the single atom dopant sites to examine in
which reaction steps the dopant Pt atoms are involved.
Speciﬁcally, if the Pt sites are selectively blocked with CO prior
to hydrogen exposure, no hydrogen is detected on the sample.

metal facets. 144 They found that H 2 , CH 4 , and NH 3
dissociation steps display diﬀerent scaling behavior than
when on the pure metal facets, while CO2 and CH3OH
dissociation did not. They rationalized this observation by
considering the distinct diﬀerences between the transition state
and the ﬁnal state geometries as seen in Figure 43. For
example, in the case of H2 dissociation, the transition state is
atop and stabilized signiﬁcantly by the isolated dopant, in
contrast to the weak binding of the ﬁnal state where the H
atom is coordinated more with the weaker binding host metal.
When one considers spillover of hydrogen such that the H
atoms are coordinated only to Cu, the deviations become even
more signiﬁcant. In contrast, the transition state for CO2
dissociation has the dissociating O coordinated to the host
in a hollow-like conﬁguration similar to the ﬁnal state. This
leads to little net stabilization of the transition state relative to
the ﬁnal state, and thus, no deviations from linear scaling are
expected for this reaction. In a recent related work, Dasgupta
and co-workers used machine learning to expand the number
of metal combinations examined.302 They use this approach to
point to SAA combinations that show the greatest potential for
deviation from traditional scaling relationships.
A combination of experimental and theoretical work has also
examined the electronic structures of SAAs. Thirumalai and
Kitchin presented a screening of 15 SAAs and found that many

This indicates that the Pt atom sites are responsible for H2
dissociation. If hydrogen is adsorbed, and then the Pt sites are
blocked with CO, subsequent exposure to butadiene and
heating results in the hydrogenation of butadiene to butene
with the same conversion and selectivity as the CO-free SAA.
This provides strong evidence for a bifunctional reaction
mechanism for selective butadiene hydrogenation on PtCu
SAAs in which the Pt sites supply the hydrogen, but the
hydrogenation occurs solely on Cu.14,59
4.3. Deviations from Linear Scaling and Novel Electronic
Structure

Linear scaling relationships that relate the energy of the
transition state to the binding energy of key intermediates have
been well established in the ﬁeld of heterogeneous catalysis.301
These scaling relationships often serve as a limit on catalyst
performance, and there has been considerable interest in
methods for deviating from the established scaling relationships in order to enhance catalyst performance. Many ideas
have been examined; some examples include metal doping,
near surface alloys, and strain eﬀects.136 Recently, experimental
and theoretical work from multiple groups has shown that
SAAs may break traditional linear scaling in some reactions.15,82,144 For instance, in a systematic study Darby and coworkers examined the scaling relationships for 5 elementary
reactions on 12 diﬀerent SAAs and compared them to the pure

5. PERSPECTIVE ON INDUSTRIAL SCALE UP OF
SINGLE-ATOM ALLOYS
The biggest challenge for the industrial adoption of promising
new catalysts is scale-up to pilot and industrial scale use.
Potential pitfalls involve either the complexity of the catalyst
synthesis (multiple steps, expensive processes, etc.) or lack of
long-term catalyst stability under the dynamic environment of
an industrial scale reactor with eﬀects such as heat losses or
temperature runaway along the bed that can deactivate the
catalyst. In terms of both these scale-up issues, SAAs appear
very promising as described below.
As discussed in section 2.3, many diﬀerent techniques can be
employed for the synthesis of SAAs in nanoparticle form.
While some SAA synthesis methods require a high level of
complexity (e.g., controlled surface reaction or galvanic
replacement), alternatives that oﬀer precise control over the
alloying (e.g., coimpregnation or sequential reduction) via
simple steps are considered ideal for the production of large
quantities of catalysts. Recently, there has even been a report of
a ball milling procedure amendable for kilogram-scale
production of SAAs.176 In terms of the thermal stability of
SAAs, as discussed in section 2.1, active site isolation is
thermodynamically favored as demonstrated in high temperature catalytic studies.35,82,235 Furthermore, loss of the single
atoms to the bulk of the host metal is not a great issue in many
SAA catalysts because the reactants and intermediates
themselves generally bind more strongly to the dopant atoms
which stabilize them in the surface.34,35
While thermal stability is not a concern for SAAs in terms of
sintering of the single atoms, the host metal particles, especially
the most common ones (i.e., Cu, Ag, Au), are susceptible to
thermal sintering. Interestingly, alloying of these metals with
small amounts of dopants can lead to higher thermal stability.
For example, Cu based catalysts used for the nonoxidative
ethanol dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde and hydrogen
require the addition of toxic chromium compounds to prevent
sintering.304 However, Cu is stabilized for prolonged periods
under nonoxidative ethanol dehydrogenation reaction conditions by the addition of very small amounts of Ni which also
promotes the reaction itself.33 These NiCu SAAs constitute
inexpensive, more environmentally friendly catalysts that
exhibit increased reactivity and stability compared to pure
Cu while retaining the high selectivity of Cu to the desirable
product, rendering this SAA system promising for use in
industry for dry alcohol dehydrogenation reactions.
This beneﬁcial eﬀect of suppressed sintering is not yet fully
understood and does not appear to be general for all SAAs. For
example, alkane dehydrogenation on PtCu SAAs was limited to
∼400 °C due to sintering of the host particles themselves.67
However, a diﬀerent synthesis approach (coimpregnation,
instead of galvanic replacementsee section 2.3) employed by
Sun and co-workers resulted in particles partially encapsulated
in the γ-Al 2 O 3 support, which allowed for propane
dehydrogenation to be performed up to 520 °C.82 Another
example of stabilizing SAAs is the use of reverse colloid
templates, used for the partial encapsulation of PdAu SAA
nanoparticles in silica, allowing for their operation at elevated
temperatures without sintering.162,163,235,305,306 Atomic layer
deposition over Cu nanoparticles has similarly been used for
the preparation of sinter-resistant catalysts and should be
completely compatible with SAAs enabling the synthesis of
more thermally robust catalysts. A wide variety of other

of these SAA combinations display sharp electronic features
near the Fermi edge.160 These sharp density of states features
correspond to the d-orbits of the isolated dopant atom in the
SAA. In general, the Cu based SAAs displayed broader
features, while the Ag and Au based SAAs displayed atom-like
narrow electronic states that are very similar to the d-states of
the gas phase atoms. A few examples from their calculations are
given in Figure 44. Thirumalai and Kitchin also showed that
the d-band center, a common descriptor of the binding
strength of metal surfaces, is not a good descriptor of the
binding energy of the dopant atoms in SAAs. They concluded
that this bodes well in terms of deviating from linear scaling.
Interestingly, work in which dopants are alloyed into more
reactive host metals such as Ni and Pt does appear to follow dband theory; that is, the d-band center is a good descriptor of
binding energy.178,179 This suggests there may be something
unique about the coinage metal SAA combinations.
Recently, this concept of isolated electronic states was
demonstrated experimentally by Greiner and co-workers.303
They examined CuAg SAA catalysts at low Cu loadings such
that the Cu atoms were isolated in the Ag host metal. As seen
in Figure 45, the XPS results show a narrow electronic state

Figure 45. Density of electronic states plots showing the free-atomlike nature of dilute Cu atom 3d states in a Ag host. (a) The measured
valence photoemission spectra (hν = 150 eV) of an AgCu alloy that
contained 0.3 atomic % Cu and metallic Ag reveal the narrow Cu 3d
states at a binding energy of ∼2.5 eV. (b) The diﬀerence spectrum of
AgCu and Ag, plotted with a Cu reference spectrum, demonstrates
that the Cu 3d states in AgCu are ﬁve times narrower than those for
bulk Cu. (Note that in this ﬁgure, Greiner and co-workers refer to
isolated Cu atoms in Ag as “AgCu” which is opposite to the notation
we have used in this review where we place dopant ﬁrst followed by
host.) Adapted with permission from ref 303. Copyright 2018

near the Fermi level which corresponds to the isolated Cu
atom in Ag. This state is in fact much more similar to the
electronic structure of gas phase Cu atoms than metallic Cu,
meaning that SAAs can have very diﬀerent electronic structures
compared to the mean ﬁeld view of metal alloying, which
serves to just shift the broad d-band in energy. These results
are exciting as they show that the electronic structure of SAAs
can be “atom-like” as is common in homogeneous catalysts in
which ligands are used to tune the electron density and hence
reactivity of the metal center. In this sense the dopants of some
SAAs that display these narrow electronic states can be thought
of in an analogous way as the metal centers in homogeneous
catalysts.

Review

while many SAAs display enhanced selectivity compared to the
pure dopant metal, this may come at the price of initial activity.
Computational screening may identify SAA combinations
which are equally as active or even more active than the parent
metal and alleviate this issue. Considering the large design
space here, machine learning may prove to be a valuable tool
once training data sets are large enough. This should also aid
progress by building up information about the energetics of
elementary steps that occur at each speciﬁc site, which will
allow researchers to move beyond bimetallics and consider
multistep pathways where multiple dopant atoms are chosen to
activate diﬀerent elementary reaction steps. There is also a
need to understand how single crystal SAA systems evolve
under industrial reaction conditions to bridge the pressure gap
between model UHV studies and SAA reactor conditions. This
is where high pressure studies on model systems can be
informative to address questions such as the dynamic role of
the dopant during reaction which are diﬃcult to address using
ﬂow reactor work alone.

methods for stabilizing metal catalysts have been described in
length in other works that the interested reader is encouraged
to explore.307−310
Some SAAs have already demonstrated great promise for
operation under industrially relevant conditions. For example,
PtCu SAAs were shown to be highly active, selective, and
stable for hydrogenation of butadiene to butene under
industrial process conditions.59 Speciﬁcally, butadiene hydrogenation is performed industrially to remove it from propylene
feedstocks prior to polymerization because butadiene poisons
the polymerization catalyst. Catalyst tests revealed that PtCu
SAAs selectively converted 1,3-butadiene to butene at mild
temperatures in excess propylene while leaving propylene
intact (<1% conversion at 100% conversion of 1,3-butadiene).
Similarly, the exhaustive investigation of Pd doped SAAs (Au,
Ag, and Cu) by the Zhang group for acetylene semihydrogenation clearly shows the successful synthesis of active,
selective, and stable SAA catalysts capable of operating at
industrially relevant conditions.74,75
As discussed, there are simple ways to synthesize large
quantities of SAA catalysts, methods to stabilize the SAA
particles against sintering, and great promise for their function
under industrially relevant conditions. Furthermore, the fact
that many SAA combinations bind CO weakly and do not
suﬀer from coking bodes well for their application in both
industrial and distributed processes such as three-way catalysts.
We have not identiﬁed any intrinsic limitations for the
widespread use of SAAs in the chemical, energy, and
automotive sectors, and we suggest that some current
industrial processes may serendipitously beneﬁt from SAA
geometries in the working phase of bimetallic catalysts,
although demonstrating this directly is very challenging.

6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
SAAs are a new type of heterogeneous catalyst that exhibit
many desirable properties. These include high selectivity to
products with resistance to deactivation, spillover pathways
leading to bifunctionality, properties that can break traditional
linear scaling, and novel electronic structures. As we have
discussed in detail, there has been considerable work in the
SAA ﬁeld in the last ∼8 years, but SAAs are still a very new
type of heterogeneous catalyst and more work is needed to
fully understand their properties in a wider range of metal
combinations and for diﬀerent reactions. In a general sense,
because of their very well-deﬁned active sites and high
selectivity SAAs can be seen as somewhat analogous to
homogeneous catalysis. Typically, heterogeneous catalysts are
stable to high temperatures but suﬀer from poor selectivity due
to the exposure of many diﬀerent and often ill-deﬁned active
sites. On the other hand, homogeneous and enzymatic
catalysts have very well-deﬁned active sites and are highly
selective, but they degrade at the high temperatures needed to
perform many industrial reactions. SAAs combine the uniform
active sites common in homogeneous catalysis with the robust
thermal stability common in heterogeneous catalysis. The
latter, combined with their exceptional catalytic activity and
facile, low-cost synthesis methods, renders SAAs as ideal
candidates for scale-up and use in industrial chemical
conversions.
Moving forward, there are many new opportunities for SAA
catalysts. The most obvious direction is to expand the number
of metal combinations and reactions examined. One area that
is particularly lacking is selective oxidations. Furthermore,

ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloys containing 1 at% carbon (C-HEAs) were additively manufactured
using selective laser melting (SLM). Superior tensile properties of the as-built C-HEA (to previously
reported ones) were achieved by utilizing multiple strengthening mechanisms (i.e. solid solution,
grain refinement, dislocation density, and nano-precipitation) by this new manufacturing method.
In particular, the SLM process could allow to maximize the strengthening effect of carbon addition to
HEAs via finely distributed nano-carbides at the boundaries of solidification cellular structure. This
work will open a new window to utilize the SLM process for enhanced mechanical properties of HEAs
with great potential.

CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloys containing 1 at% carbon were successfully produced by selective
laser melting, and the alloys exhibited much better tensile performance than additive manufactured
high-entropy alloy previously reported.

Introduction
High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are defined as alloys containing multi-principal elements with high configurational entropy [1]. Among them, the face-centered cubic
(FCC) HEAs (typically, Cantor alloy: CoCrFeMnNi [2])
have been extensively studied due to their outstanding
mechanical performance (e.g. excellent fracture toughness [3], cryogenic properties [4], and high ballistic resistance [5]). However, for engineering applications, FCC
HEAs often exhibit a critical drawback: insufficient yield
strength, while their ductility is superfluous. To overcome
these drawbacks, obtaining both high yield-strength and
reasonable ductility of HEAs has been attempted using
precipitation hardening [6] or multi-phase structure

[7,8]. In particular, it was suggested that the addition of
a small amount of interstitial atoms (e.g. carbon) to FCC
HEAs could effectively enhance their yield strength [9].
In contrast, applying novel processes to HEAs might
reveal a favorable approach for enhancing their mechanical properties. In particular, additive manufacturing
using selective laser melting (SLM) has great potential to obtain not only products of complex shapes
but also HEAs of superior mechanical properties [10].
Using this process, three-dimensional (3D) products can
be directly fabricated using high-energy laser beams
to fuse layer-upon-layer of metallic powders [11]. This
can enhance the design freedom using topology optimization for better service performance of the metallic

components. Furthermore, recent studies reported that
SLM-processed metallic materials showed a combination of improved strength and ductility due to severely
heterogeneous microstructure [10–13]. In this study, Ccontaining CoCrFeMnNi HEAs (C-HEAs) were successfully fabricated using the SLM process. Detailed investigation of the strengthening effects afforded by the SLM
process was performed in parallel with microstructural
analyses.

Materials and methods
As the raw materials, the (CoCrFeMnNi)99 C1 (at%) powder was prepared using gas atomization from vacuum
induction melted ingots to obtain spherical powder particles for the SLM process (detailed information of the
powder is in the supplementary with Supplementary Figs.
S1 and S2, and Table S1). During the SLM process, rectangular samples (30 × 6 × 6 mm3 ) were built with a 90 W
laser, with hatch space of 80 μm, and layer thickness of
25 μm, using a commercial SLM machine (Mlab, Concept Laser Ltd.). This was done at two different laser
scanning-speed conditions: 200 and 600 mm s−1 (labeled
C-HEA-V200 and C-HEA-V600 in this paper). The scanning direction rotates 180° between (N)th and (N + 1)th
layers with raster scanning patterns, and tensile specimens having a dog-bone-shape (gauge length 5.0 mm,
width 2.5 mm, thickness 1.5 mm) were made from the
as-built samples, as shown in Figure 1(a). The tensile
tests were conducted at a strain rate of 10−3 s−1 using a
universal testing machine (Instron 1361) with the digital
image correlation technique using ARAMIS 5M at room
temperature. All tensile tests were repeated at least three
times.
For microstructural characterization, all the specimens were mechanically polished to a surface roughness of 1 μm, followed by colloidal silica polishing.
Then, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out using

RIGAKU D/MAX-2500 with Cu Kα radiation, as shown
in Figure 1(b), which indicates a single FCC structure of as-built C-HEAs. Electron backscatter diffraction
(EBSD) analysis was also performed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, XL-30S
FEG, FEI Co.) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDS) detector. Elemental analysis of the
samples was conducted using an EDS and Carbon/Sulfur
determinator (CS-844, LECO Co.). Furthermore, transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2200FS, JEOL
Ltd.) analysis was performed equipped with an electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) detector for the
specimens extracted by a site-specific technique using a
focused ion beam (FIB, FEI Co.).

Results and discussion
Figure 2 indicates the EBSD maps and SEM-backscatter
electron (BSE) images of the as-built C-HEAs. The
high angle grain boundaries (HAGBs, misorientation
angles > 15°) are indicated by black lines in the EBSD
maps. As shown in the 3D inverse pole figure (IPF) maps
(Figure 2(a,d)), the as-built samples exhibited unique
microstructure due to characteristics of the SLM process: the grains on the building plane (Z plane) were
arrayed along the laser-scanning track with rectangular
shape, while the columnar grain structure was observed
along the building (Z) direction on the lateral surface of
both samples. In the present SLM process, the laser-beam
passed continuously along the X direction on the building plane of the sample, which led to the formation of a
linear arrangement of grains along the scanning tracks
with repeated rapid melting and cooling. The heat flux at
the (N + 1)th layer was directly transferred through the
Nth layer, with the formation of a columnar grain structure, by epitaxial solidification along the side opposite to
the building direction [10]. Meanwhile, the average grain
size on the Z plane of the C-HEA-V200 ( ∼ 35.5 μm) was

much larger than that of the C-HEA-V600 ( ∼ 20.3 μm).
This is attributable to a difference in the heat input during the SLM process at different scanning speeds [12].
The lower scanning speed led to higher energy input
due to a longer time of exposure to the laser beam. The
volumetric energy density (Ev ) from laser scanning for
the SLM process can be estimated using the following
equation [12]:
Ev = P/(v · h · l)

(1)

where P is the laser power, v is the scanning speed, h
is the hatch distance, and l is the layer thickness of
the SLM process. The calculated energy inputs to the
V200 and V600 samples become ∼ 225 and 75 J mm−3 ,
respectively: the value of the V200 sample is three times
higher than that of the V600 sample. The results of elemental analysis of the C-HEA samples are presented in
Table 1. This demonstrates that the manganese evaporation was more severe in the C-HEA-V200 due to the
higher heat input during the SLM process. Figure 2(b,e)
show kernel average misorientation (KAM) maps of the
C-HEA-V200 and -V600 samples (for KAM distribution profiles, see Supplementary Fig. S3), which revealed
higher KAM value distributions than for fully recrystallized alloys [8]. In most cases, the SLM-processed materials involve high dislocation density and thermal residual
stress due to the complex thermal history of a process
with a rapid-cooling rate ( ∼ 106 K/s) [10–14], which is
usually related to the solidification substructure (e.g. cellular structure) as shown in Figure 2(c,f). Interestingly,
the C-HEA-V200 showed more fraction of low angle
grain boundaries (LAGBs, misorientation angles < 15°)
than did the C-HEA-V600 (see Supplementary Table S2).
It is expected that the increased scanning speed of the
SLM process could lead to decreased thermal residual
stress for present the HEAs [14–17].

Meanwhile, as indicated in high-magnification BSE
images of the samples, nano-precipitates were obviously
detected along the boundaries of the cellular structure
(Figure 2(c,f)). Figure 3 shows TEM micrographs of the
C-HEA-V200 sample (for the C-HEA-V600, see Supplementary Fig. S4). As shown in Figure 3(a,b), the boundaries of the cellular sub-grains were decorated with highly
entangled dislocations related to high residual stress of
the SLM-produced samples [10–14]. Furthermore, the
STEM image (Figure 3(c)) clearly presents a number
of nano-precipitates with nearly spherical shape (highlighted by yellow arrows). To clarify these precipitates in
the as-built samples, elemental analysis was carried out
using the EELS mappings, as indicated in Figure 3(d).
This clearly indicates that the precipitates are a mixture
of Mn-rich oxide and sulfide, and of Cr-rich carbide with
size in the range 30–70 nm. For the C-HEA-V200 and
C-HEA-V600 samples, the measured volume fractions of
the precipitates were ∼ 1.73% and ∼ 1.13%, respectively,
based on 2D image analysis for their microstructures. It
is noteworthy that the C-HEA-V200 had a higher volume
fraction of nano-precipitates than the C-HEA-V600 had.
The precipitation of the Cr-rich carbide has usually been
reported for alloys having high Cr content (e.g. stainless steel) during the welding process, with exposure to
a specific temperature range (approximately 400–800°C),
which is generally called sensitization [18–20]. This usually results from the rapid diffusion of elemental Cr (with

high affinity for interstitial carbon) to the grain boundaries of the alloy with the formation of Cr-rich M23 C6
carbides [20]. In addition, during the welding process,
the higher heat input often leads to a slower cooling rate,
which accommodates longer exposure time of the sensitization temperature, which increases the amount of
carbides in the alloy [18–20]. Zhou et al. [21] investigated
the precipitation behavior of CoCrFeNi HEAs containing
1.2 at% carbon, which were fabricated using SLM. They
reported that the precipitation of nano-scale Cr23 C6 type carbide occurred after annealing heat treatment at
800°C. Furthermore, they reported that the volume fraction of carbides in the alloy increased with increasing

annealing time [21]. Similarly, by repeated heating and
cooling during the SLM process, the alloy could also frequently be exposed to the temperature range of Cr-rich
carbide formation, and the slower laser scanning might
lead to longer exposure time for carbide formation.
The tensile properties of the samples are displayed in
Figure 4(a). It was noted that the SLM-processed samples showed drastic enhancement of yield strength as
compared with the as-cast C-HEA. Furthermore, the
as-built 1%C-CoCrFeMnNi HEAs exhibited considerably higher strength levels than those of CoCrFeMnNi
HEAs (labeled HEA-V200 and -V600) in this works
(detailed information of as-built CoCrFeMnNi HEAs is

MATER. RES. LETT.

in the supplementary information with Supplementary
Fig. S5 and Table S3). It demonstrates that the addition
of a small amount of carbon contributed to effectively
enhance mechanical properties of SLM-processed HEAs,
while it could have a less effect on strengthening of as-cast
HEAs [9]. Moreover, the SLM-processed HEAs in this
works presented much better performance than did the
other SLM-processed HEAs as shown in Figure 4(b). This
novel improvement of mechanical properties for current
samples could be attributed to the optimized combination of various strengthening mechanisms for high yield
strength, and hierarchically heterogeneous microstructure for reasonable ductility [10,22].
The C-HEA-V200 exhibited extremely high yield and
tensile strengths ( ∼ 829 and ∼ 989 MPa, respectively),
along with a reasonable total elongation of ∼ 24.3%.
For the C-HEA-V600, it is noted that the samples also
exhibited high yield strength of ∼ 741 MPa and tensile strength of ∼ 874 MPa, whereas total elongation
( ∼ 39.7%) was slightly decreased as compared with that
of the as-cast samples ( ∼ 45.7%). Interestingly, the CHEA-V200 were much stronger than the C-HEA-V600,
although the C-HEA-V200 sample had a larger grain size.
To explore this tendency, the major strengthening
mechanisms for the SLM-processed C-HEAs were considered to be the combination of dislocation hardening,
grain refinement, and precipitation hardening [21]. This
was simplified in the following equation:
σYS = σo,c + σgb + σdisl + σppt

(2)

where σYS is the yield strength of the as-built samples, and σgb , σdisl , and σppt are the strengthening
contributions made by grain boundary, dislocation, and
precipitation, respectively. The lattice frictional strength
of the present alloy, σo,c , can be considered a summation of the friction stress of the CoCrFeMnNi HEA
(σo = ∼ 125 MPa [23]) and interstitial solid solution
effect of carbon (σc ). From the Hall–Petch relationship,
the σgb can be regarded as K · d−1/2 , where d is the
average grain size, and K is a grain boundary strengthening coefficient ( ∼ 494 MPa μm−1/2 in the CoCrFeMnNi
HEA [23]). In the C-HEA-V200 and -V600 samples,
σgb could be estimated to be ∼ 82 and ∼ 109 MPa,
respectively. Based on these estimates, the interstitial
solid solution effect (σc ) by carbon content could be calculated using the average grain size of the as-cast samples
( ∼ 800 μm). The estimated value of σc was ∼ 78 MPa,
which is almost the same as the effect of carbon interstitial strengthening on austenitic steel ( ∼ 77 MPa/at%
[24]). In addition to this, the σo,c of the present alloy was
∼ 203 MPa.
In most cases, the high dislocation density has a
key effect on the high strength level in SLM-processed

5

materials [11,22]. For the dislocation hardening effect,
the following Taylor equation can be applied [25]:
σdisl = MαGbρ 1/2

(3)

where M is the Taylor factor (3.06 for FCC materials),
α is a constant (0.2 for FCC materials [25]), G is the
shear modulus ( ∼ 81 GPa [26]), b is the Burgers vector
(estimated to be ∼ 0.254 nm from the XRD patterns in
Figure 1(d)), and ρ is the dislocation density. To determine the dislocation density of as-built samples, a convolutional multiple whole profile (CMWP) analysis was
conducted using XRD patterns (Figure 1(d)) with the
peak of LaB6 powder as a reference [27]. The measured
values of ρ were ∼ 8.5 and ∼ 5.8 × 1014 m−2 for the CHEA-V200 and -V600 samples, respectively. It should
be noted that these dislocation density values are much
higher than those in the as-cast or sintered HEAs [25].
From these data, the σdisl values of the C-HEA-V200
and -V600 samples could be estimated to be ∼ 367 and
∼ 303 MPa, respectively.

precipitate. By calculating Equations (4)–(6), the predicted values of σp were ∼ 201 and ∼ 161 MPa for
the C-HEA-V200 and -V600, respectively. As shown in
Figure 5, by substituting each strengthening contribution to Equation (2), the predicted yield strengths become
∼ 873 and ∼ 777 MPa for the C-HEA-V200 and -V600,
which exhibit good agreement with our experimental
data.

Conclusions
In this study, CoCrFeMnNi HEAs with the minor addition of carbon ( ∼ 1 at%) were excellently fabricated
using the SLM process at scanning speeds of 200 and
600 mm s−1 . The alloys exhibited significant improvement of tensile properties after the SLM process as compared with as-cast conditions. This outstanding performance of the alloys could be attributed to their complex
microstructure with a combination of various strengthening mechanisms. In particular, the addition of carbon in this work appeared to have a substantial effect
on the strength enhancement of SLM-processed CoCrFeMnNi HEAs via not only interstitial solid solution
but also precipitation hardening. In addition, the samples built at different scanning speeds exhibited different levels of strength, as explored by comparing each
strengthening contribution. The results implied that different energy input might be a major factor that could
lead to the creation of varying microstructure with disparate contributions to strengthening. This demonstrates
that our work can offer additional guidelines for optimizing the SLM process to develop the novel performance
of HEAs.

Exploiting a simple, expressive logic based
on relations to describe designs and automate
their analysis.
BY DANIEL JACKSON

Alloy:

A Language and
Tool for Exploring
Software Designs
ALLOY IS A language and a toolkit for exploring the kinds

of structures that arise in many software designs. This
article aims to give readers a flavor of Alloy in action, and
some examples of its applications to date, thus giving a
sense of how it can be used in software design work.
Software involves structures of many sorts:
architectures, database schemas, network topologies,
ontologies, and so on. When designing a software
system, you need to be able to express the structures
essential to the design and to check that they have the
properties you expect.
You can express a structure by sketching it on a
napkin. That’s a good start, but it’s limited. Informal
representations give inconsistent interpretations, and
they cannot be analyzed mechanically. So people have
turned to formal notations that define structure and
behavior precisely and objectively, and that can exploit
the power of computation.

By using formality early in development, you can minimize the costs of
ambiguity and get feedback on your
work by running analyses. The most
popular approach to advocate this is
agile development, in which the formal
representation is code in a traditional
programming language and the analysis is conventional unit testing.
As a language for exploring designs,
however, code is imperfect. It’s verbose
and often indirect, and it does not allow partial descriptions in which some
details are left to be resolved later. And
testing, as a way to analyze designs,
leaves much to be desired. It’s notoriously incomplete and burdensome,
since you need to write test cases explicitly. And it’s very difficult to use
code to articulate design without getting mired in low-level details (such as
the choice of data representations).
An alternative, which has been explored since the 1970s, is to use a design language built not on conventional machine instructions but on logic.
Partiality is free because rather than
listing each step of a computation, you
write a logical constraint saying what’s
true after, and that constraint can say
as little or as much as you please. To
analyze such a language, you use specialized algorithms such as model
checkers or satisfiability solvers (more
on these later). This usually requires
much less effort than testing, since you

simulate designs and find subtle flaws,

of applications from networking and
security to critical systems.

only need to express the property you
want to check rather than a large collection of test cases. And the analysis is
much more complete than testing, because it effectively covers all (or almost
all) test cases that you could have written by hand.
What Came Before: Theorem
Provers and Model Checkers
To understand Alloy, it helps to know
a bit about the context in which it was
developed and the tools that existed at
the time.
Theorem provers are mechanical aids
for constructing mathematical proofs.
To apply a theorem prover to a software
design problem, you formulate some
intended property of the design, and
then attempt to prove the theorem that
the property follows from the design.
Theorem provers tend to provide very
rich logics, so they can usually express
any property the designer might want,
at least about states and state transitions—more dynamic properties can
require a temporal logic that theorem
provers don’t typically support directly.
Also, because they generate mathematical proofs, which can be checked by

tools that are smaller and simpler than
the tool that finds the proof, you can be
confident the analysis is sound.
On the down side, the combination
of an expressive logic and sound proof
means that finding proofs cannot generally be automated. Theorem provers
usually require considerable effort and
expertise from the user, often orders
of magnitude greater than the effort
of constructing a formal design in the
first place. Moreover, failure to find a
proof does not mean that a proof does
not exist, and theorem provers don’t
provide counterexamples that explain
concretely why a theorem is not valid.
So theorem provers are not so useful
when the intended property does not
hold—which unfortunately is the common case in design work.
Model checkers revolutionized design analysis by providing exactly the
features theorem provers lacked. They
offer push-button automation, requiring the user to give only the design and
property to be checked. They allow
dynamic properties to be expressed
(through temporal logics), and generate counterexamples when properties
do not hold. Model checkers work by

exploring the space of possible states
of a system, and if that space is large,
they may require considerable computational resources (or may fail to terminate). The so-called “state explosion”
problem arises because model checkers are often used to analyze designs
involving components that run in parallel, resulting in an overall state space
that grows exponentially with the number of components.
Alloy was inspired by the successes
and limitations of model checkers.
For designs involving parallelism and
simple state (comprising Boolean
variables, bounded integers, enumerations and fixed-size arrays), model
checkers were ideal. They could easily find subtle synchronization bugs
that appeared only in rare scenarios
that involved long traces with multiple context switches, and therefore
eluded testing.
For hardware designs, model checkers were often a good match. But for
software designs they were less ideal.
Although some software design
problems involve this kind of synchronization, often the complexity arises
from the structure of the state itself. Early

contributed articles
model checkers (such as SMV9) had limited expressiveness in this regard, and did
not support rich structures such as trees,
lists, tables, and graphs.
Explicit state model checkers, such
as SPIN,14 and later Java Pathfinder,37
allowed designs with rich state to be
modeled, but, despite providing support for temporal properties, gave little
help for expressing structural ones. To
express reachability (for example, that
two social media users are connected
by some path of friend edges), you
would typically need to code an explicit
search, which would have to be executed at every point at which the property
was needed. Also, explicit state model
checkers have limited support for partiality (since the model checker would
have to conduct a costly search through
possible next states to find one satisfying the constraints).
Particularly difficult for all model
checkers are the kinds of designs that
involve a configuration of elements in a
graph or tree structure. Many network
protocols are designed to work irrespective of the initial configuration (or
of the configuration as it evolves), and
exposing a flaw often involves not only
finding a behavior that breaks a property but also finding a configuration in
which to execute it.
Even the few model checkers that
can express rich structures are generally not up to this task. Enumerating
possible configurations is not feasible, because the number of configurations grows super-exponentially: if
there are n nodes, there are 2n×n ways
to connect them.

Alloy was inspired
by the successes
and limitations of
model checkers.

Alloy’s Innovations
Alloy offered a new kind of design language and analysis that was made possible by three innovations:
Relational logic. Alloy uses the same
logic for describing designs and properties. This logic combines the for-all
and exists-some quantifiers of firstorder logic with the operators of set
theory and relational calculus.
The idea of modeling software designs with sets and relations had been
pioneered in the Z language.32 Alloy
incorporated much of the power of Z,
while simplifying the logic to make it
more tractable.
Alloy allows only first-order structures, thus ruling out, for example,
68

COMMUNICATIO NS O F TH E AC M

| S EPTEM BER 201 9 | VO L . 62 | N O. 9

sets of sets and relations over sets. This
changes how designs are modeled, but
not what can be modeled; after all, relational databases have flourished despite being first order.
Taking advantage of this restriction,
Alloy’s operators are defined in a very
general way so that most expressions
can be written with just a few operators. The key operator is relational join,
which in conventional mathematics
only applies to binary relations, but in
Alloy works on relations of any arity. By
using a dot to represent the join operator, Alloy lets you write dereferencing
expressions as you would in an objectoriented programming language, but
gives these expressions a simple mathematical interpretation. So, as in Java,
given an employee e, a relation dept
that maps employees to departments,
and a relation manager that maps departments to their managers, e.dept.
manager would give the manager of
e’s department. But unlike in Java, the
expression will also work if e is a set of
employees, or if dept can map an employee to multiple departments, giving
the expected result—the set of managers of the set of departments that the
employees e belong to. The expression
dept.manager is well defined too, meaning the relation that maps employees
to their managers. You can also navigate backward—writing manager.m for
the department(s) that e manages.
(A note for readers interested in
language design: This flexibility is
achieved by treating all values as relations—a set being a relation with one
column, and a scalar being a set with
one element—and defining a join operator that applies uniformly over a
pair of relations, irrespective of their
arity. In contrast, other languages tend
to have multiple operators, implicit
coercions, or overloading to accommodate variants that Alloy unifies.)
Alloy was influenced also by modeling languages such as UML. Like the
class diagrams of UML, Alloy makes it
easy to describe a universe of objects as
a classification tree, with each relation
defined over nodes in this tree. Alloy’s
dot operator was inspired in part by the
navigational expressions of the Object
Constraint Language39 (OCL) of UML,
but by defining the dot as relational
join, Alloy dramatically simplifies the
semantics of navigation.

Small scope analysis. Even plain
first-order logic (without relational operators) is not decidable. This means
that no algorithm can exist that could
analyze a software design written completely in a language like Alloy. So something has to give. You could make the
language decidable, but that would
cripple its expressive power and make
it unable to express even the most basic
properties of structures (although exciting progress has been made recently in
applying decidable fragments of firstorder logic to certain problems29). You
could give up on automation, and require help from the user, but this eliminates most of the benefit of an analysis
tool—analysis is no longer a reward for
constructing a design model, but a major extra investment beyond modeling.
The other option is to somehow
limit the analysis. Prior to Alloy, two
approaches were popular. Abstraction
reduces the analysis to a finite number
of cases by introducing abstract values
that each corresponds to an entire set
of real values. This often results in false
positives that are difficult to interpret.
In practice, picking the right abstraction calls for considerable ingenuity.
Simulation picks a finite number of cases, usually by random sampling, but it
covers such a small part of the state
space that subtle flaws elude detection.
Alloy offered a new approach: running all small tests. The designer specifies a scope that bounds each of the
types in the specification. A scope of
five, for example, would include tests
involving at most five elements of each
type: five network nodes, five packets,
five identifiers, and so on.
The rationale for this is the small
scope hypothesis, which asserts that
most bugs can be demonstrated with
small counterexamples. If you test for
all small counterexamples, you are
likely to find any bug. Many Alloy case
studies have confirmed the hypothesis
by performing an analysis in a variety
of scopes and showing, retrospectively,
that a small scope would have sufficed
to find all the bugs discovered.
Translation to SAT. Even with small
scopes, the state space of an Alloy
model is fiendishly large. The state
comprises a collection of variables
whose values are relations. Just one binary relation in a scope of five has 5 ×
5 = 25 possible edges, and thus 225 pos-

sible values. A very small design might
have five such relations, giving (225)5
possible states—about 1037 states.
Even checking a billion cases per second, such an analysis would take many
times the age of the universe.
Alloy therefore does not perform an
explicit search, but instead translates
the design problem to a satisfiability
problem whose variables are not relations but simple bits. By flipping bits
individually, a satisfiability (SAT) solver
can usually find a solution (if there is
one) or show that none exists by examining only a tiny portion of the space.
Alloy’s analysis tool is essentially a
compiler to SAT, which allows it to exploit the latest advances in SAT solvers.
The success of SAT solvers has been a
remarkable story in computer science—
theoreticians had shown that SAT was
inherently intractable, but it turned out
that most of the cases that appeared in
practice could be solved efficiently. So
SAT went from being the archetypal insoluble problem used to demonstrate
the infeasibility of other problems to
being a soluble problem that other problems could be translated to. Alloy also
applies a variety of tactics to reduce the
problem prior to solving, most notably
adding symmetry breaking constraints
that save the SAT solver from considering cases equivalent to one another.
Example: Modeling Origins
To see Alloy in action, let’s explore the
design of an origin-tracking mechanism
for Web browsers. The model shown
here is a toy version of a real model that

exposed several serious flaws in browser security.1 While it cuts corners and
is unrealistic in some respects, it does
capture the spirit and style of the original model, and is fairly representative of
how Alloy is often used.
For those unfamiliar with browser
security, cross-site request forgery
(CSRF) is a pernicious and subtle attack in which a malicious script running in a page the user has loaded
makes a hidden and unwanted request to a website for which the user
is already authenticated. This may
happen either because the user was
enticed to load a page from a malicious server, or because a supposedly
safe server was the subject of a crosssite scripting attack, and served a page
containing a malicious script. Such a
script can issue any request the user
can issue; one of the first CSRF vulnerabilities to be discovered, for example,
allowed an attacker to change the delivery address for the user’s account
in a DVD rental site. What makes
CSRF particularly insidious is that the
browser sends authentication credentials stored as cookies spontaneously
when a request is issued, whether that
request is made explicitly by the user
or programmatically by a script.
One way to counter CSRF is to track
the origins of all responses received
from servers. In this example, the
browser would mark the malicious
script as originating at the malicious or
compromised server. The subsequent
request made by that script to the rental
site server—the target of the attack—

would be labeled as having this other

so it only accepts requests that originate
directly from the user (for example, by
the user entering the URL for the request
in the address bar), or from the target
server itself (for example, from a script
embedded in a page it previously sent).
As always, the devil is in the details, and
we shall see that a plausible design of
this mechanism turns out to be flawed.
Some features to look out for in this
model, which distinguish Alloy from
many other approaches, include:
˲˲ A rich structure of objects, classification, and relationships;
˲˲ Constraints in a simple logic that
exploits the relations and sets of the
structure, avoiding the kind of low-level structures (arrays and indices especially) that are often required in model
checkers;
˲˲ Capturing dynamic behavior without any need for a built-in notion of
time or state;
˲˲ Intended properties to check expressed in the same language as the
70

COMMUNICATIO NS O F TH E ACM

model itself; and,
˲˲ An abstract style of modeling that
includes only those aspects essential to
the problem at hand.
We start by declaring a collection of
signatures (as illustrated in Figure 1).
A signature introduces a set of objects
and some fields that relate them to other objects. So Server, for example, will
represent the set of server nodes, and
has a field causes that associates each
server with the set of HTTP events that
it causes.
Keywords (or their omission) indicate the multiplicity of the relations
between objects: thus each HTTP event
has exactly one from endpoint, one to
endpoint, and one origin endpoint (line
7); each request has at most one response (line 10, with lone being read as
“less than or equal to one”); and each
response embeds any number of requests (line 13).
Mathematically speaking, objects
are just atomic identifiers without any
internal structure. The causes relation
includes tuples of the form (s, e) where

| S EPTEM BER 201 9 | VO L . 62 | N O. 9

the value of s is some atomic identifier
representing a server object, and the
value of e is some atomic identifier representing an event.
Fields are declared in signatures to
allow a kind of object-oriented mindset. Alloy supports this by resolving field
names contextually (so that field names
need not be globally unique), and by allowing “signature facts” (not used here)
that are implicitly scoped over the elements of a signature and their fields.
But don’t be misled into thinking there
is some kind of fancy object semantics
here. The signature structure is only a
convenience, and just introduces a set
and some relations.
The extends keyword defines one
signature as a subset of another. An
abstract signature has no elements
that do not belong to a child signature, and the extensions of a signature
are disjoint. So the declarations of
EndPoint, Server, and Client imply the
set of endpoints is partitioned into
servers and clients: no server is also a
client, and there is no endpoint that
is neither client nor server. A relation
defined over a set applies over its subsets too, so the declaration of from, for
example, which says that every HTTP
event is from a single endpoint, implies
the same is true for every request and
response. (Alloy is best viewed as untyped. It turns out that conventional
programming language types are far
too restrictive for a modeling language. Alloy thus allows expressions
such as HTTPEvent.response, denoting
the set of responses to any events, but
its type checker rejects an expression
such as Request.embeds that always
denotes an empty set.12)
The Alloy Analyzer can generate a
graphical representation of the sets
and relations from the signature declarations (see Figure 2); this is just an alternative view and involves no analysis.
Moving to the substance of what the
model actually means:
˲˲ The from and to fields are just the
source and destination of the event’s
packet.
˲˲ For a response r, the expression
r.embeds denotes a set of requests that
are embedded as JavaScript in the response; when that response is loaded
into the browser, the requests are executed spontaneously.
˲˲ A Redirect is a special kind of re-

contributed articles
sponse that indicates that a resource
has moved, and spontaneously issues
a request to a different server; this second request is modeled as an embedded request in the redirect response.
˲˲ The origin of an event is a notion
computed by the browser as a means of
preventing cross-site attacks. As we will
see later, the idea is that a server may
choose to reject an event unless it originated at that server or at a browser.
˲˲ The cause of an event is not part
of the actual state of the mechanism.
It is introduced in order to express the
essential design property: that an evil
server cannot cause a client to send a
request to a good server.
Now let’s look at the constraints
(as shown in Figure 3). If there were
no constraints, any behavior would be
possible; adding constraints restricts
the behavior to include only those that
are intended by design.
The constraints are grouped into
separate named facts to make the model more understandable:
˲˲ The Directions fact contains two
constraints. The first says that every request is from, and every response is to,
a client; the second says that every request is to, and every response is from,
a server. These kinds of constraints can
be written in many ways. Here I have
chosen to use expressions denoting
sets of endpoints—for example, Request.from for the set of endpoints that
requests are from, but could just as
well have written a constraint like:
from in
Request -> Client + Response -> Server

to say the from relation maps requests
to clients and responses to servers. Or
in a more familiar but less succinct
style, we could have used quantifiers:
all r: Request | r.from in Client
all r: Response | r.from in Server

(constraining only the range of the relations, which is sufficient in this case
since the declarations already constrain their domains).
˲˲ The RequestResponse fact defines
some basic properties of how requests and responses work: that every
response is associated with exactly
one request (line 22); that every response is to the endpoint its request

was from, and from the endpoint its
request was to (line 23); and that a
request cannot be embedded in a response to itself (line 24). Two expressions in these constraints merit explanation. The expression response.r
exploits the flexibility of the join operator to navigate backward from the
response r to the request it responds
to; it could equivalently be written
r.~response using the transpose operator ~. The expression r.^(response.
embeds) starts with the request r, and
then applies to it one or more navigations (using the closure operator ^) of
following the response and mbeds relations, as if we had written instead
the infinite expression
r.response.embeds
+ r.response.embeds
.response.embeds
+ r.response.embeds
.response.embeds
.response.embeds
+…

defining the requests embedded in the
response to r, the requests embedded
in the response to the requests embedded in the response to r, and so on.
(Equivalently, r.^p is the set of nodes
reachable from r in the graph whose
edges correspond to the relation p.)
˲˲ The Causality fact defines the
causes relation. It says that an event
is caused by a server if and only if it is

from that server, or is embedded in a
response that the server causes.
˲˲ The Origin fact describes the origin-tracking mechanism. Each constraint defines the origin of a different kind of HTTP event. The first (line
31) says that every embedded request
e has the same origin as the response
r that it is embedded in. The second
(line 32) defines the origin of a response: it says if the response is a redirect, it has the same origin as the original request, and otherwise its origin
is the server that the response came
from. The third (line 33) handles a request that is not embedded: its origin
is the endpoint it comes from (which
will usually be the browser).
Finally, EnforceOrigins is a predicate
that can be applied to a server, indicating that it chooses to enforce the origin
header, allowing incoming requests
only if they originate at that server, or
at the client that sent the request.
With all this in place—the structure of endpoints and messages, the
rules about how origins are computed
and used, and the definition of causality—we can define a design property to
check (as illustrated in Figure 4).
The keyword check introduces a
command that can be executed. This
command instructs the Alloy Analyzer
to search for a refutation for the given
constraint. In this case, the constraint
asserts the nonexistence of a crosssite request forgery attack; refuting

this will show that the origin mechanism is not designed correctly, and an
attack is possible.
The constraint says that there are no
two servers, good and bad, such that the
good server enforces the origin header
(line 40), there are no requests sent directly to the bad server that originate
in the client (line 41), and yet there is
some request to the good server that
was caused by the bad server (line 42).

(with a 2.6GHz i7 processor and 16GB
of RAM).
The counterexample can be displayed in various ways—as text, a table,
or a graph whose appearance can be
customized. I’ve chosen the graph option, and have selected which objects
are to appear as nodes (just the events
and the servers), which relations are to
appear as edges (those between events,
and causes), and I’ve picked colors for
the sets and relations. I have also chosen to use the Skolem constants (witnesses that the analyzer finds for the
quantified variables) good and bad to
label the servers.
Reading the graph from the top,
looking just at the large rectangles
representing the HTTP events, we see
a request (Req1) was sent from a client to the good server. The response
(Resp) embeds a request (Req0) that is
sent to the bad server; this is a crosssite request, which will not be rejected
because the bad server accepts incoming requests irrespective of origin. The
bad server’s response is to send a redi-

| S EPTEM BER 201 9 | VO L . 62 | N O. 9

rect whose embedded request (Req2) is
received by the good server. (Note that
the numbering of objects is arbitrary:
Req1 actually happens before Req0.)
Looking at the server nodes and the
events they cause, we see that, as expected, the good server caused the response
to the first request, and the bad server
caused the redirect and its subsequent
embedded request. The problem is the
mismatch between cause and origin in
the last request (Req2): we can see that it
was caused by the bad server, but it was
labeled as originating at the good server. In other words, the origin tracking
design is allowing a cross-site request
forgery by incorrectly identifying the
origin of the request in the redirect.
The solution to this problem turns
out to be non-trivial. Updating the origin header after each redirect would
fail for websites that offer open redirection; a better solution is to list a chain
of endpoints in the origin header.1
Agile Modeling
As mentioned earlier, our model is representative of many Alloy models. But
the way I presented it was potentially
misleading. In practice, users of Alloy
don’t construct a model in its entirety
and then check its properties. Instead,
they proceed in a more agile way, growing the model and simulating and
checking it as they go.
Take, for example, the constraint on
line 24 of Figure 3. Initially, I had not
actually noticed the need for this constraint. But when I ran the check for
the first time (without this constraint),
the analyzer presented me with counterexamples such as the one shown in
Figure 6, in which the response to a request is the very response in which the
request is embedded!
One way to build a model exploiting
Alloy’s ability to express and analyze
very partial models is to add one constraint at a time, exploring its effect.
You do not need a property to check;
you can just ask for an instance of the
model satisfying all the constraints.
Doing this even before any explicit
constraints have been included is very
helpful. You can run just the data model by itself and see a series of instances
that satisfy the constraints implicit
in the declarations. Often doing this
alone exposes some interesting issues.
In this case, the first few instances in-

contributed articles
clude examples with no HTTP events,
and with requests and responses that
are disconnected.
To get more representative instances, you can specify an additional
constraint to be satisfied. For example,
the command

Like the class
diagrams of UML,
Alloy makes it easy
run (some response)
to describe
will show instances in which the response relation has some tuples. The a universe
first one generated (Figure 7) shows
of objects as
a request with a response that is a redirect from the same source as the a classification tree,
request, and sent to an endpoint that
is also its origin, and it includes an with each relation
orphaned redirect unrelated to any re- defined over
quest! These anomalies immediately
nodes in this tree.
suggest enrichments of the model.
When we developed Alloy, we underestimated the value of this kind of
simulation. As we experimented with
Alloy, however, we came to realize
how helpful it is to have a tool that can
generate provocative examples. These
examples invariably expose basic misunderstandings, not only about what’s
being modeled but also about which
properties matter. It’s essential that
Alloy provides this simulation for free:
in particular, you do not need to formulate anything like a test case, which
would defeat the whole point.
Growing a model in a declarative
language like Alloy is very different
from growing a program in a conventional programming language. A program starts with no behaviors at all,
and as you add code, new behaviors
become possible. With Alloy, it’s the
opposite. The empty model, since it
lacks any constraints, allows every possible behavior; as you add constraints,
behaviors are eliminated.
This allows a powerful style of incremental development in which you
only add constraints that are absolutely essential for the task at hand—
whether that is eliminating pathological cases or ensuring a design
property holds.
Typically a model includes both
a description of the mechanism being designed and some assumptions
about the environment in which it operates. Our example model does not
separate these rigorously, but where
brevity is not such a pressing concern,
it would be wise to do so. We could sep-

arate, for example, the constraints that
model the setting and checking of the
origin field from those that describe
what kinds of requests and responses
are possible.
Obviously, the less you assume
about the environment, the better,
since every assumption you make is a
risk (as it may turn out to be untrue).
In our model, for example, we do not
require every request to have a response. It would be easy to do—just
change the declaration of response
in line 10 of Figure 1 by dropping the
lone keyword—but would only make
the result of the analysis less general.
Likewise, the less you constrain the
mechanism, the better. Allowing multiple behaviors gives implementation
freedom, which is especially important in a distributed setting.
Simulation matters for a more
profound reason. Verification—that
is, checking properties—is often
overrated in its ability to prevent
failure. As Christopher Alexander
explains,2 designed artifacts usually
fail to meet their purposes not because specifications are violated but
because specifications are unknown.
The “unknown unknowns” of a software design are invariably discovered
when the design is finally deployed,
but can often be exposed earlier by
simulation, especially in the hands
of an imaginative designer.
Verification, in contrast, is too narrowly focused to produce such discoveries. This is not to say property checking
is not useful—it’s especially valuable
when a property can be assured with
high confidence using a tool such as
Alloy or a model checker or theorem
prover (rather than by testing). But
its value is always contingent on the
sufficiency of the property itself, and

Uses of Alloy
Hundreds of papers have reported on
applications of Alloy in a wide variety
of settings. Here are some examples
to give a better idea of how Alloy has
been used:
Critical systems. A team at the University of Washington constructed a
dependability case18 for a neutron radiotherapy installation. The team devised an
ingenious technique for verifying properties of code against specifications using lightweight, pluggable checkers.
The end-to-end dependability case
was assembled in Alloy from the code
specifications, properties of the equipment and environment, and the expected properties, and then checked
using the Alloy Analyzer. The analysis
found several safety-critical flaws in
the latest version of the control software, which the researchers were able
to correct prior to its deployment. For
a full description, see a recent research
report30 and additional information on
the project’s website.36
Network protocols. Pamela Zave, a
researcher at AT&T, has been using Alloy for many years to construct and analyze models of networking as well as
for designing a new unifying network
architecture. In a major case study,
she analyzed Chord, a distributed hash
table for peer-to-peer applications. The
original paper on Chord33—one of the
most widely cited papers in computer
science—notes that an innovation of
Chord was its relative simplicity, and
consequently the confidence users
can have in its correctness. By modeling and analyzing the protocol in Alloy, Zave showed that the Chord protocol was not, in fact, correct, and she
was able to develop a fixed version that
maintains its simplicity and elegance
while guaranteeing correct behavior.43 Zave also used the explicit model
checker SPIN14 in this work, and wrote
an insightful article explaining the relative merits of the two tools, and how she
used them in tandem.42
Web security. The demonstration example of this article is drawn from
a real study performed by a research
group at UC Berkeley and Stanford.1 The
group constructed a library of Alloy
models to capture various aspects of

Web security mechanisms, and then
analyzed five different mechanisms,
including: WebAuth, a Web-based authentication protocol based on Kerberos deployed at several universities
including Stanford; HTML5 forms;
the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
protocol; and proposed designs for
using the referrer header and the origin header to foil cross-site attacks
(of which the last is the basis for the
example here). The base library was
written in 2,000 lines of Alloy; the various mechanisms required between 20
and 214 extra lines; and every bug was
found within two minutes and a scope
of 8. Two previously known vulnerabilities were confirmed by the analysis,
and three new ones discovered.
Memory models. John Wickerson
and his colleagues have shown that
four common tasks in the design of
memory models—generating conformance tests, comparing two memory
models, checking compiler optimizations, and checking compiler mappings—can all be framed as constraint
satisfaction problems in Alloy.41 They
were able to reproduce automatically
several results for C11 (the memory
model introduced in 2011 for C and
C++) and common compiler optimizations associated with it, for the memory models of the IBM Power and Intel
x86 chips, and for compiler mappings
from OpenCL to AMD-style GPUs.
They then used their technique to develop and check a new memory model
for Nvidia GPUs.
Code verification. Alloy can also be
used to verify code by translating the
body of a function into Alloy, and asking it to find a behavior of the function that violates its specification.
Greg Dennis built a tool called Forge
that wraps Alloy so it can be applied
directly to Java code annotated with
JML specifications. In a case study
application, 10 he checked a variety of
implementations of the Java collections list interface, and found bugs
in one (a GNU Trove implementation). Dennis also applied his tool
to KOA, an electronic voting system
used in the Netherlands that was annotated with JML specifications and
had previously been analyzed with
a theorem-proving tool, and found
several functions that did not satisfy
their specifications.11

contributed articles
Civil engineering. In one of the
more innovative applications of Alloy,
John Baugh and his colleagues have
been applying Alloy to problems in
large-scale physical simulation. They
designed an extension to ADCIRC—
an ocean circulation model widely
used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and others for simulating hurricane storm surge—that introduces a
notion of subdomains to allow more
localized computation of changes
(and thus reduced overall computational effort). Their extension, which
has been incorporated into the official ADCIRC release, was modeled
and verified in Alloy.7
Alloy as a backend. Because Alloy
offers a small and expressive logic,
along with a powerful analyzer, it has
been exploited as a backend in many
different tools. Developers have often
used Alloy’s own engine, Kodkod,34
directly, rather than the API of Alloy
itself, because it offers a simpler programmatic interface with the ability
to set bounds on relations, improving performance. Jasmin Blanchette’s
Nitpick tool,8 for example, uses Kodkod to find counterexamples in Isabelle/HOL, saving the user the trouble
of trying to prove a theorem that is not
true, and the Margrave tool26 analyzes
firewall configurations. Last year, a
team from Princeton and Nvidia built
a tool that uses Alloy to synthesize security attacks that exploit the Spectre
and Meltdown vulnerabilities.35
Teaching. Alloy has been widely
taught in undergraduate and graduate courses for many years. At the University of Minho in Portugal, Alcino
Cunha teaches an annual course on
formal methods using Alloy, and has
developed a Web interface to present
students with Alloy exercises (which
are then automatically checked). At
Brown University, Tim Nelson teaches
Logic for Systems, which uses Alloy
for modeling and analysis of system
designs, and has become one of the
most popular undergraduate classes.
Because the Alloy language is very
close to a pure relational logic, it has
also been popular in the teaching of
discrete mathematics, for example, in
a course that Charles Wallace teaches
at Michigan Technological University38 and appearing as a chapter in a
popular textbook.15

Alloy Extensions
Many extensions to Alloy—both to
the language and to the tool—have
been created. These offer a variety of
improvements in expressiveness, performance, and usability. For the most
part, these extensions have been mutually incompatible, but a new open
source effort is now working to consolidate them. There are too many efforts
to include here, so I focus on representatives of the main classes.
Higher-order solving. The Alloy Analyzer’s constraint-solving mechanism
cannot handle formulas with universal
quantifications over relations—that
is, problems that reduce to “find some
relation P such that for every relation
Q …” This is exactly the form that many
synthesis problems take, in which the
relation P represents a structure to be
synthesized, such as the abstract syntax tree of a program, and the relation
Q represents the state space over which
certain behaviors are to be verified. Alloy*24 is an extension of Alloy that can
solve such formulas, by generalizing a
tactic known as counterexample-guided inductive synthesis that has been
widely used in synthesis engines.
Temporal logic. Alloy has no built-in
notion of time or dynamic behavior.
On the one hand, this is an asset, because it keeps the language simple,
and allows it to be used very flexibly.
I exploited this in the example model
here, where the flow of time is captured in the response relation that
maps each request to its response. By
adding a signature for state, Alloy supports the specification style common
in languages such as B, VDM, and Z;
and by adding a signature for events,
Alloy allows analysis over traces that
can be visualized as a series of snapshots. On the other hand, it would
often be preferable to have dynamic
features built into the language. Electrum20 extends Alloy with a keyword
var to indicate that a signature or field
has a time-varying value, and with
the quantifiers of linear temporal
logic (which fit elegantly with Alloy’s
traditional quantifiers). DynAlloy31
offers similar functionality, but using dynamic logic instead, and is the
basis of an impressive code analysis
tool called TACO13 that outperforms
Forge (mentioned earlier) by employing domain-specific optimizations.

No extension of Alloy, however, has yet
addressed the problem of combining
Alloy’s capacity for structural analysis
with the ability of traditional model
checkers to explore long traces, so Alloy analyses are still typically limited to
short traces.
Instance generation. The result of
an Alloy analysis is not one but an
entire set of solutions to a constraintsolving problem, each of which represents either a positive example of
a scenario, or a negative example,
showing how the design fails to meet
some property. The order in which
these appear is somewhat arbitrary,
being determined both by how the
problem is encoded and the tactics
of the backend SAT solver. Since SAT
solvers tend to try false before true
values, the instances generated tend
to be small ones—with few nodes and
edges. This is often desirable, but is
not always ideal. Various extensions
to the Alloy Analyzer provide more
control over the order in which instances appear. Aluminum28 presents
only minimal scenarios in which every relation tuple is needed to satisfy
the constraints, and lets the user add
new tuples, automatically compensating with a (minimal) set of additional tuples required for consistency.
Amalgam27 lets users ask about the
provenance of an instance, indicating
which sub formula is responsible for
requiring (or forbidding) a particular
tuple in the instance. Another extension21 of the Alloy Analyzer generates
minimal and maximal instances, and
choosing a next instance that is as
close to, or as far away from, the current instance as possible.
Better numerics. Alloy handles numerical operations by treating numbers as bit strings. This has the advantage of fitting into the SAT solving
paradigm smoothly, and it allows a
good repertoire of integer operations.
But the analysis scales poorly, making
Alloy unsuitable for heavily numeric
applications. The finite scopes of Alloy
can also be an issue when a designer
would like numbers to be unbounded.
A possible solution is to replace the
SAT backend with an SMT backend
instead. This is challenging because
SMT solvers have not traditionally
supported relational operators. Nevertheless, a team at the University of

SE PT E MB E R 2 0 1 9 | VO L. 6 2 | N O. 9 | C OM M U N IC AT ION S OF T HE ACM

75

contributed articles
Iowa has recently extended CVC4, a
leading SMT solver, with a theory of
finite relations, and has promisingly
demonstrated its application to some
Alloy problems.23
Configurations. Many Alloy models
contain two loosely coupled parts,
one defining a configuration (say of a
network) and the other the behavior
(say of sending packets). By iterating
through configurations and analyzing
each independently, one can often
dramatically reduce analysis time.22
In some applications, a configuration
is already fully or partially known, and
the goal is to complete the instance—
in which case searching for the configuration is a wasted effort. Kodkod,
Alloy’s engine, allows the explicit definition of a “partial instance” to support this, but in Alloy itself, this notion is not well supported (and relies
on a heuristic for extracting partial
instances from formulas in a certain
form). Researchers have therefore
proposed a language extension25 to
allow partial instances to be defined
directly in Alloy itself.
How to Try Alloy
The Alloy Analyzer3 is a free download available for Mac, Windows,
and Linux. The Alloy book16 provides
a gentle introduction to relational
logic and to the Alloy language, gives
many examples of Alloy models, and
includes a reference manual and a
comparison to other languages (both
of which are available on the book’s
website17). The Alloy community
answers questions tagged with the
keyword alloy on StackOverflow, and
hosts a discussion forum.5 A variety of
tutorials for learning Alloy are available online too, as well as blog posts
with illustrative case studies and
examples (for example, Kriens 19
and Wayne 40). The model used in
this article is available (along with
its visualization theme) in the Alloy
community’s model repository.4

CONSPECTUS: Metal alloys exhibit functionalities unlike those of single metals. Such alloying has drawn considerable
research interest, particularly for nanoscale particles (metal clusters/nanoparticles), from the viewpoint of creating new
functional nanomaterials. In gas phase cluster research, generated alloy clusters can be spatially separated with atomic precision
in vacuum. Thus, the inﬂuences of increases or decreases in each element on the overall electronic structure of the cluster can be
elucidated. However, to further understand the related mixing and synergistic eﬀects, alloy clusters need to be produced on a
large scale and characterized by various techniques. Because alloy clusters protected by thiolate (SR) can be synthesized by
chemical methods and are stable in both solution and the solid state, these clusters are ideal study materials to better understand
the mixing and synergistic eﬀects. Moreover, the alloy clusters thus created have potential applications as functional materials.
Therefore, since 2008, we have been working on establishing a precise synthesis method for SR-protected alloy clusters and
elucidating their mixing and synergistic eﬀects.
Early research focused on the precise synthesis of alloy clusters wherein some of the Au in the stable SR-protected gold clusters
([Au25(SR)18]− and [Au38(SR)24]0) is replaced by Pd, Ag, or Cu. These studies have shown that Pd, Ag, or Cu substitute at
diﬀerent metal sites. We also have examined the as-synthesized alloy clusters to clarify the eﬀect of substitution by each element
on the physical and chemical properties of the clusters. However, in early studies, the number of substitutions could not be
controlled with atomic accuracy for [Au25−xMx(SR)18]− (M = Ag or Cu). Then, in following research, methods have been
established to obtain alloy clusters with control over the composition. We have succeeded in developing a method for
controlling the number of Ag substitutions with atomic precision and thereby elucidating the eﬀect of Ag substitution on the
electronic structure of clusters with atomic precision. Concurrently, we also studied alloy clusters containing multiple
heteroelements with diﬀerent preferential substitution sites. These results revealed that the eﬀects of substitution of each
element can be superimposed on the cluster by combining multiple elemental substitutions at diﬀerent sites. In addition, we
successfully developed methods to synthesize alloy clusters with heterometal core. These ﬁndings are expected to lead to clear
design guidelines for developing new functional nanomaterials.

1. INTRODUCTION

Kitagawa et al. reported that mixing of Ag and Rh at the
nanoscale creates an electronic state similar to Pd, which is
located between the two elements on the periodic table.2 In this
way, alloying has attracted considerable attention in the ﬁeld of
metal clusters from the viewpoint of generating nanomaterials
with new physical or chemical properties and functionalities.

Alloys produced by the mixing of diﬀerent metals have been
used in weapons, agricultural implements, ritual artifacts, and
jewelry since the bronze age (3000 BC). In recent years, alloying
has drawn considerable research interest, particularly in the ﬁeld
of nanoscale particles (i.e., metal clusters or nanoparticles). For
example, Toshima et al. reported that the catalytic activity of a
147-palladium-atom cluster (Pd147) can be greatly improved
when Pd atoms on its surface are partially substituted with Au.1

produced to understand the details of the mixing eﬀects through
multiple characterization methods.
Thiolate (SR)-protected gold clusters (Aun(SR)m)6 are metal
clusters that can be chemically synthesized. In addition,
Aun(SR)m clusters exhibit higher stability than other metal
clusters in solution and the solid state because of the strong
bonds between SR and Au. For such Aun(SR)m clusters,
measurement methods, which are used for metal-complex or
organic compounds, can also be applied to elucidate the
fundamental properties of the metal clusters. Since 2000,
through the eﬀorts of Whetten et al.,7 Murray et al.,8 and
Tsukuda et al.,9 it has become possible to control the number of
constituent atoms in these Aun(SR)m clusters with atomic
precision. In 2005, an author of this article (Y. Negishi) also
contributed to the isolation of a series of the Aun(SG)m clusters

The mixing and synergistic eﬀects induced by alloying can be
understood at the atomic scale through gas phase cluster
research.3,4 In gas phase studies, the alloy cluster ions generated
by atomic aggregation in vacuum are spatially separated with
atomic precision, and the electronic structure of each alloy
cluster is examined by various laser spectroscopy tools. This
method enables the elucidation of changes in the electronic
structure induced by mixing of heteroelements with atomic
precision. In terms of the mixing eﬀects of alloying, one of the
authors of this article (Y. Negishi) also examined these systems
in gas phase clusters. As a result, changes in the electronic
structure of Au−Ag alloy clusters (AunAgm; 2 ≤ n + m ≤ 4)
depending on the numbers of each element were successfully
clariﬁed.5 However, a large amount of alloy clusters must be

ambiguous chemical composition of two stable clusters to be
Au25(SR)18 and Au38(SR)24.10−12 For Aun(SR)m clusters,
changes in optical absorption,10 luminescence,10 and magnetism13 with the number of Au atoms have been also elucidated.
The use of this type of cluster to study mixing eﬀects might also
enable us to elucidate details of mixing eﬀects via multiple
measurements. However, to achieve this objective, methods for
synthesizing alloy clusters with atomic precision had to be
established. Therefore, since 2008, we have worked on
establishing a method to precisely synthesize SR-protected
alloy clusters and elucidate mixing eﬀects in the resultant
clusters. This Account describes our endeavors and summarizes
developments in our laboratory related to Au-based alloy
clusters.

under appropriate conditions in the presence of dodecanethiol
in solution, aﬀording the desired Au24Pd(SC12H25)18 together
with multiple byproducts. Several separation methods were
applied to the obtained mixture, and the targeted Au24Pd(SC12H25)18 was ultimately isolated in high purity (Figure 2a).
The obtained cluster was deﬁnitively found to be neutral
[Au24Pd(SC12H25)18]0.19
During this research, Murray et al. reported the formation of
Au24Pd(SC2H4Ph)18, based on a ligand containing a diﬀerent R
group;20 however, the geometric structure of the formed cluster
was not reported. Therefore, we attempted to elucidate the
geometric structure by performing laser-fragmentation mass
spectrometry on the [Au24Pd(SC12H25)18]0 isolated in high
purity and used DFT calculations to examine [Au24Pd(SCH3)18]0. As a result, we could conclude that [Au24Pd(SC 12 H 25 ) 18 ] 0 has a core−shell-type structure (Pd@
Au12[Au2(SR)3]6) (Figure 2b), in which the central Au atom
of Au25(SC12H25)18 is replaced with a Pd atom, as expected.19
The geometric structure of [Au24Pd(SR)18]0 determined in this
study was experimentally veriﬁed later by 197Au Mössbauer
spectroscopy,21 extended X-ray absorption ﬁne structure
(EXAFS) measurements,21 and ultimately SCXRD (Figure
2c)22,23 conducted by other groups. We also investigated the
eﬀects of Pd substitution on the chemical properties of clusters
based on the synthesized [Au24Pd(SC12H25)18]0 and revealed
that Pd substitution improves the stability of the cluster in
solution (Figure 2d)19 and also improves the reactivity of the
ligand-exchange reaction (Figure 2e).24
Regarding Pd substitution, we also studied another stable
cluster, [Au38(SR)24]0.25 Accordingly, we succeeded in isolating
Au36Pd2(SC2H4Ph)24 (Figure 3a), wherein two Au atoms were
substituted with Pd. Au38(SC2H4Ph)24 contains two icosahedral
Au 13 cores (Figure 1b). 26 Thus, we concluded that
Au36Pd2(SC2H4Ph)24 also has a core−shell structure in which
Au in the center of two Au13 cores is replaced by Pd (Figure 3b).
These predicted structures were strongly supported by a later
study of Lee, Jiang, et al., which combined experiments and DFT
calculations.27 Subsequent studies on stability have revealed that
Pd substitution improves cluster stability in solution, even for
[Au38(SC2H4Ph)24]0 (Figure 3c).25 Barrabés and Bürgi also
studied Au36Pd2(SC2H4Ph)24 and revealed that the Pd doping
leads to a substantial lowering of the racemization temperature.28

2. Pd-DOPED Au24Pd(SR)18 AND Au36Pd2(SR)24
Among base Aun(SR)m clusters for heteroelement substitution,
we ﬁrst focused on [Au25(SR)18]−, which is one of the stable
clusters. For [Au25(SR)18]−, the geometry of
[Au25(SC2H4Ph)18]− (SC2H4Ph = phenylethanethiolate) was
independently determined by Murray et al.14 and Jin et al.15 in
2008 through single crystal X-ray diﬀraction (SCXRD).
Concurrently, a theoretical group also predicted the same
structure based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations
of [Au25(SCH3)18]− (SCH3 = methanethiolate).16 These
studies revealed that [Au25(SR)18]− has the geometry of
Au13[Au2(SR)3]6, wherein an icosahedral Au13 core is protected
by six −SR−[Au−SR−]2 staples (Figure 1a).
Within this structure, we focused our attention on the
icosahedral Au13 core. In an icosahedral structure composed of
13 identical elements, the atomic distances between the surface
atoms are longer by ∼5% compared with the atomic distance
between the central atom and the 12 surface atoms. In this
structure, the central atom is easily replaced by an element with a
small atomic radius.3 In fact, for a cluster containing phosphine
as a ligand, there have been reports of the synthesis of core−
shell-type Au12Pd clusters (Pd@Au12) that contained Pd (1.38
Å), with an atomic radius smaller than that of Au (1.44 Å), at the
center.17 Walter et al. predicted by DFT calculation that
replacing the central atom of [Au25(SR)18]− with Pd would lead
to more stable clusters than [Au25(SR)18]−.18 On the basis of
these reports, we ﬁrst focused on Pd as the substituting element
and synthesized Au24Pd(SR)18 in which the Au atom at the
center of [Au25(SR)18]− was replaced by a Pd atom.
In this synthesis, we used dodecanethiolate (SC12H25) as the
ligand. Gold and palladium salts were simultaneously reduced

substitutions in our studies, but later, the Jin group reported
the synthesis of [Au25−xAgx(SC6H11)18]− (SC6H11 = cyclohexanethiolate) containing ∼21 Ag atoms33 and the Bakr group
reported the synthesis of [AuAg24(SPhMe2)18]− (SPhMe2 = 2,4dimethylbenzenethiolate) composed entirely of Ag except for
the central Au atom.34 For this type of 25-atom cluster
containing a large number of Ag atoms, SCXRD revealed that
Ag was also contained in the staples covering the metal core.
These studies have mostly included a distribution in the
number of Ag substitutions except for [AuAg24(SPhMe2)18]−,
which can be considered to be a silver-based cluster. In recent
years, there have been several reports on the controlled synthesis
of Aun−xAgx(SR)m clusters, such as [Au16Ag(S-Adm)13]0 (SAdm = adamantanethiolate),35 [Au20Ag(StBu)15]0 (StBu = tertbutanethiolate),36 [Au24Ag46(StBu)32]2+,37 and
[Au12Ag32(SPhF2)30]4− (SPhF2 = 3,4-diﬂuorobenzenethiolate).38 However, to the best of our knowledge, there have
been no reports on the isolation of the most studied 25-atom
alloy clusters, Au25−xAgx(SR)18. To address this problem and
deepen our understanding of mixing eﬀects in Au25−xAgx(SR)18,
we recently established techniques to control the substitution
number in Au25−xAgx(SR)18.
In one of our attempts, we established a high-resolution
separation method for Au25−xAgx(SR)18. We devoted consid-

this study. Unlike Pd, Ag replaced multiple Au atoms
([Au25−xAgx(SC12H25)18]−; x = 1−11; Figure 4a).29 The
electronic structure of [Au25−xAgx(SC12H25)18]− changed
continuously depending on the number of substituted Ag
atoms. Comparing the electronic structure of the series
[Au25−xAgx(SC12H25)18]− (x = 1−11), Ag substitution was
found to increase the energy gap between the highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) of the cluster (Figure 4b,c).29
During this study, Aikens reported DFT calculations on the
electronic structure of Ag13[Au2(SH)3]6, in which the Au13 core
of [Au25(SR)18]− was replaced by Ag13.30 The electronic
structure of Ag13[Au2(SH)3]6 predicted by Aikens was similar
to that of [Au25−xAgx(SC12H25)18]− obtained in our study.29
Furthermore, DFT calculations on [Au24Ag(SCH3)18]− by
Walter et al. suggested that in the energetically most stable
structure, Ag replaced Au at the surface of the Au13 core.18 On
the basis of these DFT calculations and our X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy results, we concluded that Ag substitution
occurred at the surface of the central 13 metal core in
[Au25−xAgx(SC12H25)18]− (Figure 4d).29 The structure predicted for [Au25−xAgx(SR)18]− was later experimentally veriﬁed
by EXAFS measurements31 and SCXRD (Figure 4e)32
conducted by other groups. We reported up to 11 Ag

speciﬁc sites. On the basis of these expectations, we reacted
[Au24M(SC2H4Ph)18]0 (M = Pd or Pt) with a Ag(I)−SC2H4Ph
complex and Au20Ag4M(SC2H4Ph)18 (M = Pd or Pt) was
produced as the main product (Figure 7a,b).43 Furthermore,
SCXRD revealed that Ag existed at the expected sites with a high
occupancy (Figure 7c,d).43 In this study, the central Au atom
was replaced by Pd. Therefore, control over the substitution
number and substitution sites in [Au25−xAgx(SR)18]− was not
necessarily achieved. However, this study suggested that it might
be possible to achieve control in [Au25−xAgx(SR)18]−, when a
distortion is induced in the geometric structure. We expect that
in the near future [Au25−xAgx(SR)18]− could be synthesized with
atomic precision by introducing a strain in the geometry of
[Au25−xAgx(SR)18]−, for example, through control of the R
group of the ligand44,45 as ﬁrst shown in 2013 by TlahuiceFlores44 or the charge state of the cluster.46

erable eﬀort to isolate Au25−xAgx(SR)18 with atomic precision by
improving the resolution of the reverse-phase high-performance
liquid chromatography39 (Figure 5). As a result, we succeeded in
separating [Au25−xAgx(SC4H9)18]0 (SC4H9 = butanethiolate; x
= 1−4) depending on the substitution number (Figure 6a−e).40
Furthermore, we successfully clariﬁed the changes in the
electronic structure of [Au25−xAgx(SC4H9)18]0 for a number of
Ag substitutions with atomic accuracy (Figure 6f).40,41 In this
study, we also succeeded in separating each
[Au25−xAgx(SC4H9)18]0 cluster into its structural isomers
(Figure 6g).41 We used this separation method to determine
the distribution of isomers in each [Au25−xAgx(SC4H9)18]0
(Figure 6).41 We expect that this monitoring method might
enable us to control the isomer distribution of each
Au 25−x Ag x (SC 4 H9 ) 18 and also to elucidate the growth
mechanism42 of this type of alloy cluster.
As shown in this example, for Au25−xAgx(SR)18, in addition to
the substitution number, there is also a distribution in the
substitution sites (Figure 6e,g). This distribution appears to be
closely related to the highly symmetric geometry of
[Au25(SR)18]−/0 (Figure 1a). In contrast, for the aforementioned compounds, including [Au 16 Ag(S-Adm) 13 ] 0 and
[Au20Ag(StBu)15]0, there are gold atoms in the metal core that
are not equivalent to the other gold atoms. Interestingly, Ag
substitution occurs at these speciﬁc sites. On the basis of these
facts, we considered inducing a distortion in the geometric
structure of Au25(SR)18 to control Ag substitution. According to
previous studies, replacing the central atom of [Au25(SR)18]−
with Pd or Pt induces a distortion in the geometric structure of
the cluster: the four metal−metal bonds in the metal core
became slightly longer than the other bonds.19,22,23 The Ag
forms longer bonds with Pd and Pt compared with Au. Thus,
when Ag substitutes Au in [Au24M(SR)18]0 (M = Pd or Pt), Ag is
expected to be preferentially located at four speciﬁc sites, leading
to Ag-substituted clusters with a ﬁxed substitution number at

4. Cu-DOPED Au25−XCuX(SR)18 AND Au25−XCuX(SeR)18
We also studied Cu substitution into [Au25(SR)18]−. Similar to
Ag, Cu belongs to the same group (XI) as Au. However, unlike
Ag (1.45 Å), Cu (1.28 Å) has a smaller atomic radius than that of
Au (1.44 Å). Thus, Cu substitution induces distortion in the
geometry of the cluster and thereby a maximum of ﬁve Au atoms
could be replaced by Cu atoms.47 Furthermore, the generated
Cu-substituted product rapidly degraded in a solution (Figure
8a).47 To generate clusters with a larger number of Cu
substitutions, the clusters were modiﬁed to improve their
stability. According to our previous research, changing the ligand
from thiolate to a selenolate (SeR) improves cluster stability.48
Therefore, for Cu-substituted clusters, we used octaneselenolate
(SeC8H17) for the synthesis. We succeeded in generating stable
[Au25−xCux(SeC8H17)18]−, with up to nine Cu substitutions
(Figure 8b).49 Optical absorption spectra of the series of
obtained clusters indicated that Cu substitution decreased the
HOMO−LUMO gap of the cluster, in contrast to the eﬀects of

stability of the cluster substituted with a single Cu atom
([Au23CuPd(SC12H25)18]0) via Pd substitution (Figure 10a).56
To conﬁrm our hypothesis, we further introduced Ag into the
aforementioned trimetal cluster. The structural analysis of the
obtained clusters ([Au24−x−yAgxCuyPd(SC12H25)18]0; x = 1−3, y
= 1, 2) strongly suggested that Pd, Ag, and Cu were substituted
at diﬀerent sites.54 Furthermore, theoretical analysis of the
electronic structure strongly suggested that the substitutional
eﬀects of each element were superimposed on the electronic
structure of the produced cluster (Figure 10b).54 These results
indicate that the eﬀects of substitution with each metal on the
electronic structure are additive in nature and that the electronic
structure of 25-atom Au clusters can be modulated for objective
applications in a predictable manner. In the future, we expect
that many metal clusters with electronic structures suitable for
speciﬁc applications could be obtained by substitution of
multiple elements at diﬀerent priority sites.

was revealed that Cu readily replaces Au in the staples (Figure
1a) in contrast to either Pd or Ag (Figure 8d).3

5. TRIMETAL AND TETRAMETAL CLUSTERS
Substitution of Au25(SR)18 has been reported for elements of
group IX (Ir50), X (Pd19 and Pt51), XI (Cu47 and Ag29), and XII
(Cd52 and Hg52,53). Furthermore, there are priority sites that are
susceptible to replacement by these elements (Figure 9).54 If we
select elements with diﬀerent priority sites and perform
substitutions with these elements, the substitution eﬀects of
each heteroelement might be imparted to the cluster in an
additive manner. Hence, we studied simultaneous substitution
based on multiple heteroelements for Au25(SR)18.
In the initial approach, we selected Pd and Cu as substituting
elements (Figure 9). As mentioned above, Cu substitution
induces cluster instability.47 In contrast, central atom substitution by Pd increases the interaction energy between the
central atom and the surrounding Au12 cage55 and thereby
induces cluster stabilization.19 Herein, we counterbalanced the
destabilization owing to Cu substitution through stabilization by
Pd substitution, thereby generating stable Cu-substituted
clusters. As a result, we succeeded in greatly improving the

The icosahedral 13 metal cores contained in Au25(SR)18 and
Au38(SR)24 can be the constituting units for a cluster of clusters.
For example, Teo et al. reported the synthesis of bi-icosahedral

wherein only one central atom was replaced by a heteroatom in
two icosahedral 13-atom cores and elucidated the electronic
structure of the cluster.
In that study, Pd was chosen as the substituting element at the
center of Au13. Under suitable experimental conditions,
[Au24Pd(PPh3)10(SC2H4Ph)5Cl2]+ containing one Pd atom
was selectively synthesized (Figure 11a).60 The SCXRD
revealed that [Au24Pd(PPh3)10(SC2H4Ph)5Cl2]+ has a heterobi-icosahedral core wherein only one central atom was replaced
by Pd (Figure 11b) in two icosahedral 13-atom cores.60 The
DFT calculations of Jiang et al. suggested that [Au24Pd(PPh3)10(SC2H4Ph)5Cl2]+ has a dipole moment in the cluster.60
The electrochemical measurements of the product indicated
that [Au24Pd(PPh3)10(SC2H4Ph)5Cl2]+ is comparatively stable
to reduction (Figure 11c).60 These results indicate that
[Au24Pd(PPh3)10(SC2H4Ph)5Cl2]+ has desirable properties for
a molecular rectiﬁer or dipole material applications. We expect
that these ﬁndings will lead to clear design guidelines for creating
nanomaterials, such as molecular rectiﬁers and dipole materials,
based on bi-icosahedral 25-atom clusters.

could behave as a molecular rectiﬁer or a dipole material.59

7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Following our studies on alloy clusters in the latter half of the
1990s, we became interested in the mixing eﬀects produced by
alloying. Since 2008, we have been working toward a precise
synthesis method for substitution of heteroatoms into alloy

clusters containing SR ligands. We have successfully established
a precise synthesis method for SR-protected alloy clusters
containing Pd, Ag, and Cu and elucidated the mixing eﬀects in
these alloy clusters. Moreover, we also succeeded in establishing
a method for creating alloy clusters with heterostructure. We
expect that our ﬁndings in relation to SR-protected alloy clusters
and those obtained by other groups might serve as clear design
guidelines for creating new functional nanomaterials. In the
future, a deeper understanding on the formation42 and reaction
mechanisms61 of alloy clusters is needed. This knowledge might
enable alloy clusters with desired functionalities to be
synthesized based on design, similar to organic and metalcomplex compounds. We also expect that techniques to
regularly assemble alloy clusters will be developed to enable
these applications. Although several reports related to these
techniques have already appeared recently,62 we hope that
research in this ﬁeld will continue to expand in the future.

Ternary strategy has been considered as an efficient method to achieve high performance polymer solar
cells (PSCs). A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.22% is achieved in the optimized ternary PSCs with
10 wt% MF1 in acceptors. The over 8% PCE improvement by employing ternary strategy is attributed to the
simultaneously increased JSC of 25.68 mA cm2, VOC of 0.853 V and FF of 78.61% compared with Y6 based
binary PSCs. The good compatibility of MF1 and Y6 can be confirmed from Raman mapping, contact angle,
cyclic voltammetry and morphology, which is the prerequisite to form alloy-like state. Electron mobility in
ternary active layers strongly depends on MF1 content in acceptors due to the different lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of Y6 and MF1, which can well explain the wave-like varied FF of ternary
PSCs. The third-party certified PCE of 16.8% should be one of the highest values for single bulk heterojunction PSCs. This work provides sufficient references for selecting materials to achieve efficient ternary PSCs.

1. Introduction
Single bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs) have
achieved dramatic progress through material evolution, device fabrication optimization and working mechanism exploration [1–9].
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has already
exceeded 16% with narrow band gap nonfullerene material Y6 as
acceptor [10–14]. Based on the well optimized binary PSCs, ternary
strategy also exhibits great potential in improving PSCs performance by selecting the well matched third component and
employing appropriate device engineering [15–18]. The enhanced
photon harvesting of active layers can be achieved by employing
appropriate materials with complementary absorption spectra,
which is the prerequisite for obtaining efficient PSCs. The third
component was used as morphology regulator to optimize phase
separation for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport
in ternary active layers [19–21]. The exciton utilization efficiency
can be improved through the additional channels of intermolecular
energy/charge transfer [22–24]. The highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) level and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital

(LUMO) level of the third component are vital parameters to form
efficient charge transport channels in ternary active layers with
two donors or acceptors, respectively. Meanwhile, the appropriate
energy levels of the third component can achieve relatively high
open circuit voltage (VOC) compared with the host binary PSCs,
leading to the minimal energy loss by employing ternary strategy
[15,25–31]. Most of efficient ternary PSCs work under alloy-like
model, which were well designed by employing two donors or
two acceptors with good compatibility, appropriate energy levels
and complementary absorption spectra [32–35]. The alloy-like
concept is commonly confirmed from the gradually varied VOCs
of ternary PSCs dependence on the third component content. The
alloy-like state should be the excited electrons mixture of two well
mixed materials, the energy levels of alloy-like state will be
slightly adjusted by altering each component content, leading to
the gradually varied VOCs of ternary PSCs. The surface energy,
energy levels, compatibility of used materials and morphology of
ternary active layers were commonly characterized to investigate
alloy-like state in ternary PSCs [32,36–38]. In this work, Raman
mapping technology is employed to investigate the preferred distribution of the third component in host blend films, and the good
compatibility of used materials should be the prerequisite to form
alloy-like state.

A series of PSCs were fabricated with polymer PM6 as donor,
narrow band gap material Y6 and medium band gap material
MF1 as acceptor [39,40]. The two small molecular acceptors Y6
and MF1 prefer to form alloy-like state due to their good compatibility, which can be confirmed from the experimental results of
Raman mapping images, contact angle, cyclic voltammetry and
morphology. The photon harvesting and phase separation of ternary active layers can be simultaneously optimized by finely adjusting MF1 content in acceptors. A PCE of 17.22% and the third-party
certified PCE of 16.8% are achieved in the optimized ternary PSCs
with 10 wt% MF1 in acceptors, resulting from the simultaneously
increased short-circuit current density (JSC) of 25.68 mA cm2,
VOC of 0.853 V and fill factor (FF) of 78.61% compared with Y6 based
binary PSCs. Over 8% PCE improvement is achieved by employing
ternary strategy compared with the well optimized binary PSCs
exhibiting a 15.93% PCE. The selection of the third component
should be comprehensively deliberated from the properties of used
materials and photovoltaic parameters of two binary PSCs for
achieving efficient ternary PSCs. This work further confirms the
great potential of ternary strategy in achieving efficient PSCs with
the simple cell fabrication technology.

2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
PDIN (Lot# WJ425A), PM6 (Lot# ZJ415B), and Y6 (Lot# YJ319A)
were purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc and used as received.
The number-average molecular weight (Mn) of the PM6 offered by
the company is about 30 kDa, and the polydispersity index (PDI) is
around 2.3. PEDOT:PSS (clevios P VP Al 4083) was purchased from
H.C. Starck co. Ltd. MF1 was synthesized by Chuluo Yang’s group.
2.2. PSCS fabrication and measurement
The patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates
(sheet resistance 15 X1) were consecutively cleaned in ultrasonic
baths containing detergent, de-ionized water and ethanol, respectively. Then, poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly-(styrenesul
phonicacid) (PEDOT:PSS) thin films were fabricated on the cleaned
ITO substrates by spin-coating method at 5000 r min1 for 40 s,
and then annealed at 150 °C for 10 min in the air conditions. After
annealing treatment, ITO substrates coated with PEDOT:PSS films
were transferred to a high purity nitrogen filled glove box. The
used materials PM6, Y6 and MF1 were dissolved in chloroform
(CF) with the solvent additive of 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) (0.5%,
v/v) to prepare 16 mg mL1 blend solutions. The weight ratios of
Y6 to MF1 are 1:0, 0.95:0.05, 0.9:0.1, 0.85:0.15, 0.7:0.3, 0.5:0.5,
0.3:0.7, 0.1:0.9, 0:1, and the weight ratio of donor to acceptor(s)
is kept constant as 1:1.2. The blend solutions were spin-coated
on PEDOT:PSS films in a high purity nitrogen filled glove box to
fabricate the active layers. The active layers were annealed with
carbon disulfide solvent vapor for 40 s and then annealed at
80 °C for 5 min. The optimized thickness of the active layer is
~110 nm, which was measured by Ambios Technology XP-2 stylus
Profiler. After that, PDIN solution (2 mg mL1 in methanol with
0.25 vol% acetic acid) was spin-coated on the top of active layers
at 5000 r min1 for 30 s. The 100 nm Al cathode was deposited
by thermal evaporation with a shadow mask under 104 Pa vacuum conditions and the thickness was monitored by a quartz crystal microbalance. The active area of PSCs is about 3.8 mm2, which is
defined by the vertical overlap of ITO anode and Al cathode. The
characterizations on films and PSCs are presented in the Supplementary materials.

3. Results and discussion
The chemical structures of PM6, MF1 and Y6 are shown in
Fig. 1a. There are apparently complementary absorption spectra
among the three materials, as displayed in Fig. 1b, which should
be beneficial to enhance photon harvesting of ternary active layers,
which is the prerequisite for achieving efficient ternary PSCs. The
energy levels of used materials are described in Fig. 1c. The LUMO
level (3.89 eV) of MF1 is slightly higher than 4.05 eV of Y6,
resulting in relatively large VOC of MF1 based binary PSCs in comparison with that of Y6 based binary PSCs. The MF1 content in
acceptors was finely adjusted from 10 wt% to 90 wt% for achieving
the well-balanced photon harvesting and charge transport in ternary active layers. The conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:
PSS/active layer/PDIN/Al was employed and exhibited in Fig. 1d.
The current density-voltage (J-V) of PSCs were investigated
under AM 1.5G illumination with 100 mW cm2 light intensity.
The detailed J-V curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE)
spectra of all binary and ternary PSCs are shown in Fig. S1 (online).
The photovoltaic parameters of PSCs dependence on MF1 content
are displayed in Fig. 2a, the detailed values with errors are listed
in Table S1 (online). The JSCs of PSCs are slightly increased to
25.68 mA cm2 by incorporating 10 wt% MF1 in acceptors and then
gradually decreased with the more MF1 incorporation. The VOCs
are gradually improved along with increase of MF1 content in
acceptors, which can be well explained from the slightly uplifted LUMO levels of Y6:MF1 blend films along with MF1 content
increasing. The LUMO levels of neat Y6, MF1 and mixed Y6:MF1
films can be evaluated according to the cyclic voltammetry curves,
as shown in Fig. S2 (online). The gradually varied VOC dependence
on the third component content has been commonly reported in
ternary PSCs working under alloy-like model [36,41,42]. The FFs
of ternary PSCs are increased to 78.61% with 10 wt% MF1 and then
decreased to 70.57% with 50 wt% MF1, and finally increased to
76.62% with 90 wt% MF1 in acceptors. The wave-like varied FF
dependence on the third component content has already reported
by different research groups and the underlying reason on this
phenomenon is rarely discussed [43–45]. The wave-like varied FF
of ternary PSCs should be attributed to the variation of charge
transport dependence on the third component content. In this
work, electron transport in ternary active layers will become very
complex along the Y6:MF1 formed channels dependence on their
relative content. The more isolated electron traps will be formed
in the ternary active layers with MF1:Y6 closing to 1:1 (wt/wt)
due to their different LUMO levels and good compatibility, resulting in the decreased electron transport in the ternary active layers.
A PCE of 17.22% is achieved from the optimized ternary PSCs with
10 wt% MF1 in acceptors, and the average PCE of optimized ternary
PSCs is 17.02% according to 30 individual cells (Table S2 online).
The certified PCE of 16.8% was achieved by the National Institute
of Metrology (NIM), China and the certified report is exhibited in
Fig. S3 (online), which should be one of the highest certified values
for single bulk heterojunction PSCs. The detailed discussions about
the effect of MF1 content on PSCs performance are carried out on
the basis of the typical PSCs, including two binary PSCs, ternary
PSCs with 10 wt% or 50 wt% MF1 content in acceptors.
The J-V curves and EQE spectra of the typical PSCs are shown in
Fig. 2b and c, respectively. The two binary PSCs exhibit the complementary photovoltaic parameters: JSC (25.11 vs. 16.67 mA cm2)
and VOC (0.843 vs. 0.914 V) and FF (75.27% vs. 79.37%), leading to
PCE (15.93% vs. 12.09%) of binary PSCs with Y6 and MF1 as acceptor, respectively. A 17.22% PCE is achieved from the optimized
ternary PSCs with 10 wt% MF1 in acceptors, resulting from the
simultaneously increased JSC of 25.68 mA cm2, VOC of 0.853 V
and FF of 78.61% in comparison with the corresponding

photovoltaic parameters of Y6 based binary PSCs. The markedly
improved PCE of ternary PSCs should be attributed to the combination of complementary photovoltaic parameters of two binary PSCs
and the complementary absorption spectra of used materials. It
should be highlighted that EQE values of the optimized ternary
PSCs are slightly enhanced in the whole spectral range, especially
in the wavelength range from 700 to 900 nm. The enhanced EQE
values in long wavelength range are mainly due to the well-

developed phase separation for efficient exciton dissociation and
charge transport. The key photovoltaic parameters of the typical
OPVs are summarized in Table 1.
To further clarify the effect of MF1 content on photon harvesting of active layers, the absorption spectra of active layers in cells
were investigated and are shown in Fig. 2d. The reflected spectra of
PSCs and a special device with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS
(30 nm)/PMMA (110 nm)/PDIN (10 nm)/Al were measured and

The values in parentheses are average and deviation values based on individual 30 cells.
Certificated parameters of the optimized ternary PSCs.

are shown in the Fig. S4 (online). It is apparent that absorption
spectral shape of active layers in cells is very similar to the corresponding EQE spectral shape. Although Y6 content is decreased in
the optimized ternary active layers, photon harvesting may be well
kept in the long wavelength range. The slightly increased EQE values in long wavelength can be well explained by the relatively
large FF of the optimized ternary PSCs. The refractive index and
extinction coefficient of blend films were measured by a spectroscopic ellipsometer and are exhibited in Fig. S5 (online). The light
field distribution of cells and photogenerated exciton distribution
in active layers were calculated according to transfer matrix
method and are exhibited in Fig. S6 (online) [46–49]. The detailed
calculation processes are described in the Supplementary
materials. The photogenerated exciton distribution in Y6 based
binary active layers and the optimized ternary active layers are
exhibited in Fig. 2e for better comparison. The exciton generation
rate in the whole optimized ternary active layers is 3.28  1029 m3 s1
and larger than 3.26  1029 m3 s1 of Y6 based binary active layers, suggesting that photon harvesting can be enhanced in the optimized ternary active layers. Meanwhile, photogenerated exciton
distribution in ternary active layers can be slightly adjusted far
away from ITO side due to the varied refractive index and extinction coefficient, which should be beneficial to improve electron
collection for achieving the more balanced electron and hole collection. The exciton generation rate in the middle (50 nm) zone

of the optimized ternary active layers is 1.62  1029 m3 s1, which
is larger than 1.61  1029 m3 s1 of the Y6 based binary active layers. The enhanced photon harvesting and the optimized photogenerated exciton distribution in the optimized ternary active layers
can well explain the slightly enhanced EQE values of the optimized
ternary PSCs in the whole spectral range. To further investigate the
effect of MF1 content on photon utilization of active layers in long
wavelength range, an 800 nm cut-off optical filter was covered
onto the cells during J-V curves measurement. The transmittance
spectrum of the filter and schematic diagram of PSCs covered with
the filter for J-V measurement are shown in Fig. S7 (online). The J-V
curves of the typical PSCs covered with the filter and the corresponding key photovoltaic parameters are exhibited in Fig. 2f.
The JSC and FF of the optimized ternary PSCs covered with the filter
are 2.72 mA cm2 and 79.13%, which are slightly larger than
2.65 mA cm2 and 77.18% of Y6 based binary PSCs covered with
the same filter, indicating that photon utilization efficiency in the
optimized ternary PSCs should be enhanced by incorporating
appropriate MF1 content due to the simultaneously enhanced JSC
and FF.
To further clarify the effect of MF1 incorporation on charge generation and transport in active layers, the photocurrent density
(Jph) of typical PSCs were investigated under different effective
voltage (Veff), the Jph-Veff curves of the typical PSCs are exhibited
in Fig. 3a. Here, Jph can be determined by JL–JD, where JL and JD

are the current density under light illumination and in the dark,
respectively. Veff is defined as V0–Va, V0 is the voltage where
Jph = 0, the applied voltage is defined as Va. The exciton dissociation, charge transport and collection efficiency will be considered
as 100% under large Veff conditions, the saturated current density
(Jsat) will be mainly determined by the total photogenerated exciton density in the active layer. As seen from the Table S3 (online),
the relatively large Jsat of the optimized ternary PSCs should be
attributed to the increased photogenerated exciton density in the
optimized ternary active layers, which well accords with the calculated photogenerated exciton density (exhibited in Fig. 2e). Obviously, the Jph of the optimized ternary PSCs rapidly arrives into
the saturated state under relatively low Veff, indicating the more
efficient charge transport and collection in the optimized ternary
PSCs. The more efficient charge transport in the optimized ternary
active layers can be further confirmed from the well-balanced
charge mobility dependence on MF1 content. The exciton dissociation efficiency (gd) or charge transport and collection efficiency
(gc) can be estimated by the Jph/Jsat values under short circuit
conditions and maximum power output conditions, respectively
[50–53]. The gd of the optimized ternary PSCs is 95.18% and
slightly larger than 94.50% of Y6 based binary PSCs, suggesting that
phase separation can be well optimized by incorporating appropriate MF1 for efficient exciton dissociation. The gc of the optimized
ternary PSCs is 87.10% and larger than 84.38% of Y6 based binary
PSCs and 82.01% of ternary PSCs with 50 wt% MF1 in acceptors,
which is slightly less than 88.22% of MF1 based binary PSCs. The
JSC dependence on light density of PSCs can be expressed as JSC/ Plighta obeying the power-law, as described in Fig. 3b. The parameter a represents bimolecular recombination degree in active
layers [54,55]. The a of 0.985 for the optimized ternary PSCs is
higher than that of 0.977 for Y6 based binary PSCs, indicating the
weakened bimolecular recombination in the optimized ternary
active layers. The VOC versus Plight relationship is described as
VOC / skT/qln(Plight), as shown in Fig. 3c. Where k is the Boltzmann
constant, T is absolute temperature, and q represents the elementary charge. The parameter s represents the trap-assisted recombination degree in active layers [56–58]. s is decreased from 1.06 for
Y6 based binary PSCs to 1.03 for the optimized ternary PSCs and
then increased to 1.15 for ternary PSCs with 50 wt% MF1, and
finally decreased to 1.02 for MF1 based binary PSCs. The trapassisted charge recombination process can be restrained in the
optimized ternary PSCs due to the decreased s compared with that
of Y6 based binary PSCs. s is equal to 1.15 for the ternary PSCs with
50 wt% MF1 in acceptors, indicating that trap-assisted charge
recombination becomes serious in the ternary active layers, leading to the relatively low 70.57% FF of the ternary PSCs with
50 wt% MF1 in acceptors. The enhanced trap-assisted charge
recombination should be induced by the more isolated electron
traps formed by Y6 and MF1 with different LUMO level and good
compatibility. The bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination
can be markedly weakened in the optimized ternary PSCs, resulting in the efficient charge transport and the relatively high FF of
78.61%. The hole mobility (lh) and electron mobility (le) were
investigated in active layers with different MF1 content in acceptors (Fig. S8 online), the lh and le dependence on MF1 content
are exhibited in Fig. 3d and Table S4 (online). The le in active layers are slightly increased for MF1 content up to 10 wt% in acceptors
and then markedly decreased for MF1 content up to 50 wt% in
acceptors, further increased along with the more MF1 incorporation, suggesting that electron transport channels can be finely
adjusted by incorporating MF1. The markedly decreased le in ternary active layers with 50 wt% MF1 should be ascribed to the more
isolated electron traps along electron channels formed by Y6 and
MF1. The lh in MF1 based binary active layers is slightly larger
than that in Y6 based binary active layers, which can explain the

gradually increased lh in ternary active layers with the increase
of MF1 content.
To further investigate the compatibility among the used materials, Raman spectra of neat films were measured and are exhibited
in Fig. S9 (online). Raman mapping images of blend films can be
plotted according to the Raman characteristic peak of each material [59–61], as exhibited in Fig. 3e. The blue, red and yellowgreen color regions represent PM6, Y6 and MF1 in blend films,
respectively. As seen from Raman mapping images of ternary blend
films, MF1 should prefer to mix with Y6 due to most of yellowgreen spots embedded in the red zone, indicating the good compatibility between MF1 and Y6. The good compatibility of MF1
and Y6 is the prerequisite to form alloy-like state, which can make
the excited state electrons shared by MF1 and Y6. The excited
energy levels of alloy-like states can be slightly adjusted by altering the weight ratio of MF1 and Y6. The electron mobility in ternary active layers should be mainly determined by the alloy-like
state dependence on MF1 content in acceptors. To further confirm
the compatibility of used materials, contact angle measurements
on each thin film were performed using two different liquids (water, ethylene glycol) to obtain the more accurate contact angle, as
exhibited in Fig. S10 (online). The surface energy of neat PM6, Y6
and MF1 films are 23.7, 31.1 and 30.4 mN m1, respectively. The
interfacial energy between Y6 and MF1 is cY6-MF1  0.09 mN
m1, which is much smaller than cPM6-Y6  1.07 mN m1 and
cPM6-MF1  1.25 mN m1, further suggesting the good compatibility
of Y6 and MF1. The detailed calculation information is described in
the Supplementary materials. According to Raman mapping
images and their surface/interfacial energy, MF1 should prefer to
well mix with Y6, which is conducive to form alloy-like state of
Y6:MF1 in blend films. According to the above analysis on charge
mobility and morphology of blend films, as well as the contact
angle of neat and blend films the schematic diagram of materials
distribution in blend films are exhibited in Fig. 2f. The left schematic diagram is the active layers with 10 wt% MF1 content in
acceptors, photogenerated electrons prefer to transport along the
channels formed by Y6. The right schematic diagram is active layers with 50 wt% MF1 content in acceptors, photogenerated electrons may be hampered in the ternary active layers due to the
more isolated electron traps formed by Y6 and MF1.
Grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and
grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) were performed to gain deeper insights onto the effect of MF1 content on
molecular arrangement and phase separation of active layers.
The two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS patterns of neat PM6, MF1
and Y6 films are described in Fig. S11a (online). The out of plane
(OOP) and in-plane (IP) direction profiles of PM6, MF1 and Y6 films
are plotted in Fig. S11b (online). The profiles of neat PM6 films
exhibit strong (1 0 0) and (0 1 0) diffraction peak in OOP direction
and relatively weak (1 0 0) and (0 1 0) diffraction peak in IP direction, suggesting the co-existence of face-on and edge-on molecular
orientation. The 3D molecular arrangement is beneficial to hole
transport in neat PM6 films [62–65]. The 2D GIWAXS patterns
and 1D profiles of the typical blend films are shown in Fig. 4a
and b, respectively. The PM6 molecular arrangement in PM6:Y6
blend films should be slightly disturbed by incorporating Y6 due
to the absence of (1 0 0) diffraction peak in OOP direction. It is very
interesting that four diffraction peaks in IP and OOP directions can
be clearly observed from the profiles of the ternary blend films,
suggesting that PM6 molecular arrangement in ternary blend films
can be optimized by incorporating appropriate MF1. The wellordered molecular arrangement of PM6 is very conducive to hole
transport in the ternary active layers, which can be confirmed by
the slightly increased hole mobility in active layers along with
the increase of MF1 content. In the profiles of ternary blend films
with 10 wt% MF1, both (0 1 0) diffraction peak in OOP direction

and (1 0 0) diffraction peak in IP direction are more pronounced
than those in PM6:Y6 blend films, which can well explain the
simultaneously increased le and lh in the optimized ternary blend
films. The apparent diffraction peak at ~0.4 Å1 in IP direction originating from MF1 can be clearly observed in the profile of PM6:
MF1 blend films, as confirmed from the profiles of neat MF1 films
in the Supplementary materials, suggesting that MF1 should prefer
to keep face-on molecular orientation in PM6:MF1 blend films.
MF1 should prefer to well-mix with Y6, rather than form some
individual domains in the ternary active layers with 50 wt% MF1
content in acceptors due to the absence of diffraction peak at
~0.4 Å1 in IP direction in the profile of ternary blend films. The
ternary PSCs should work under alloy-like model, rather than
parallel-like model due to the absence of individual electron transport channels formed by MF1 in ternary active layers.

The domain size is another important morphological factor
influencing the performance of PSCs. The GISAXS (2D patterns
and 1D profiles) on the typical blend films were carried out to
investigate domain size dependence on MF1 content, as described
in Fig. 4c and d. The fitted parameters, the average correlation
length (n) of PM6 phase, size of clustered acceptor domain (2Rg)
[66–68], are summarized in Table S5 (online). The n value of
22.2 nm in Y6 based binary blend films is higher than that of
19.6 nm in MF1 based binary blend films. The n values of ternary
blend films are slightly increased to 22.6 and 22.4 nm for incorporating 10 wt% and 50 wt% MF1 content in acceptors, respectively,
suggesting that MF1 may prefer to disperse into Y6 domain, rather
than PM6 domain. The 2Rg of 52.1 nm in the optimized ternary
blend films is slightly less than those of 66.1 and 60.2 nm in Y6
and MF1 based binary blend films, indicating the slightly adjusted

544

Q. An et al. / Science Bulletin 65 (2020) 538–545

phase separation in the optimized blend films. The 2Rg in ternary
blend films with 50 wt% MF1 in acceptors is markedly increased
to 110.4 nm, resulting from the preferentially mixed Y6 and MF1.
The more isolated electron traps will be formed in the ternary
active layers with Y6:MF1 weight ratio as 1:1 due to their different
LUMO levels and good compatibility, resulting in significantly
decreased le and FF. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to characterize
morphology of the blend films, as shown in Fig. S12 (online). The
phase separation of active layers can be markedly adjusted by
incorporating appropriate MF1, which can be clearly observed
from the AFM and TEM images. The fiber-like structure can be
clearly seen from AFM images of the optimized ternary blend films
compared with that of Y6 based binary blend films. The welldeveloped fiber-like structure can also be observed from TEM
images of the optimized ternary blend films. These results suggest
that phase separation of ternary active layers can be well optimized by incorporating appropriate MF1 as morphology regulator.
4. Conclusions
In summary, a series of PSCs were prepared with PM6 as donor,
Y6:MF1 with various MF1 content as acceptor. A PCE of 17.22% and
the third-party certified PCE of 16.8% are achieved in the optimized
ternary PSCs, resulting from the synergistically increased JSC, VOC
and FF in comparison with the corresponding parameters of Y6
based binary PSCs. The performance improvement of ternary PSCs
should be attributed to the synergistically optimized photon harvesting, exciton dissociation, charge transport and collection in
ternary active layers with appropriate MF1 content. The good compatibility of Y6 and MF1 can be confirmed from the characterizations of Raman mapping image, contact angle, cyclic
voltammetry curves and morphology of neat and blend films,
which should be conducive to form alloy-like state for achieving
efficient ternary PSCs. The properties of used materials and photovoltaic parameters of two binary PSCs should be comprehensively
deliberated to select appropriate materials for achieving efficient
ternary PSCs. The work further confirms that ternary strategy
should be an efficient method to further improve the performance
of PSCs by incorporating appropriately the third component on the
basis of binary PSCs with 15.93% PCE, while keeping the simple cell
fabrication process.

Atomically precise alloy nanoclusters: syntheses, structures,
and properties
Xi Kang,‡,a,b Yingwei Li,‡,c Manzhou Zhu,*,a,b and Rongchao Jin*,c
Metal nanoclusters fill the gap between discrete atoms and plasmonic nanoparticles, providing unique opportunities for
investigating the quantum effects and precise structure-property correlations at the atomic level. As a versatile strategy,
alloying can largely improve the physicochemical performances compared to corresponding homo-metal nanoclusters, and
thus benefit the applications of such nanomaterials. In this Review, we highlight the achievements of atomically precise
alloy nanoclusters, and summarize the alloying principles and fundamentals, including the synthetic methods, sitepreferences for different heteroatoms in the templates, and alloying-induced structure and property changes. First, based
on various Au or Ag nanocluster templates, heteroatom doping modes are presented. The templates with electronic shellclosing configurations tend to maintain their structures during doping, while the others may undergo transformation and
give rise to alloy nanoclusters with new structures. Second, alloy nanoclusters of specific magic sizes are reviewed. The
arrangement of different atoms is related to the symmetry of the structures, i.e., different atom(s) are symmetrically
located in the nanoclusters of smaller sizes, and evolve to the shell-by-shell structure at larger sizes. Then, we elaborate on
the alloying effects in terms of optical, electrochemical, electroluminescent, magnetic and chiral properties, as well as the
stability and reactivity via comparisons between the doped nanoclusters and their homo-metal counterparts. For example,
the central heteroatom-induced photoluminescence enhancement is emphasized. The applications of alloy nanoclusters in
catalysis, chemical sensing, bio-labeling, and other fields are further discussed. Finally, we provide perspectives on existing
issues and future efforts. Overall, this Review provides a comprehensive synthetic toolbox and controllable doping modes
so as to achieve more alloy nanoclusters with customized compositions, structures, and properties for applications. This
review is based on publications available up to February 2020.

1 Introduction
1.1 Overview of alloying
In retrospect to the development of metallurgy, the material
properties of metals have fascinated human beings since the
Bronze Age. The new epoch began when mankind discovered
that mixing two (or more) different metals could produce an
alloy that was much stronger than the individual metals.
It has been more than 5000 years since the ancient work
on “alloying”, but this concept is still of critical importance in
modern metal industry for enhancing the performance of
metals. For instance, iron is prone to be oxidized (or rusted)
when exposing to an environment containing oxygen, water,
or salts. By contrast, alloying iron with a small amount of
carbon and chromium produces steel that exhibits highly
oxidation-proof surface; and hybrid steel displays much higher

mechanical strength relative to iron. From iron to steel,
scientists have demonstrated that the improved oxidation
resistance of steel results from the compact film of Cr-based
oxide which prevents the exposure of iron surface to the
environment, and the enhanced mechanical strength of steel
stems from the hardening agents within iron (e.g. carbon)
which prevent the movement of dislocations.
1.2 From bulk to nanoscale alloys
Aside from its ubiquitous use in industrial applications such as
manufacturing hybrid materials, the alloying strategy is now
displaying its indispensable value in nanoscience as well.1-12
The synergistic effects between metals have been extensively
applied in producing alloy nanoparticles with enhanced
properties relative to homo-metallic ones.4-6,13-21 Studies on
nanoparticels demonstrate that the size, shape, and
composition are the three major factors that are responsible
for the controllable properties of nanoparticles.5-7,22-26
As for the size effect, Raman spectroscopy is enhanced
with the help of nanoparticles in which visible light can be
readily absorbed by stimulating LSPR (localized surface
plasmon resonance).27-29 In the case of catalysis, it has been
well-established that the catalytic activity of metal
nanoparticles can be significantly enhanced by reducing their
size.24,30-32 As for the shape effect, the catalytic selectivity is

sensitive to the packing modes of the surface atoms, or the
different exposed facets (Miller indices {hkl}) of
nanoparticles.22,23,33-35 A prototypical example is the highly
active Pt nanoparticles, whose {100} and {210} facets are most
active for H2 or CO production.36,37 Thus, it is of great
importance to control the size and shape so as to endow
nanoparticles with favorable facets for better catalytic activity
and selectivity. Besides, for metal nanoparticles with fixed size
and shape, mastering over the metal composition will enable
the manipulation of its physicochemical properties and
broaden the practicability in specific applications.5,38-44 In other
words, alloying nanoparticles from homo-composition to bimetallic or multi-metallic compositions will enrich their
physicochemical properties, and make them superior to their
homo-metallic counterparts in many cases. Alloying-induced
enhancement of properties was discovered back in the Bronze
Age. For instance, the platinum group metals (including Pt, Pd,
and Ru) are widely used in chemical catalysis as well as in
pharmaceutical, pesticide, and polymeric industries;45
remarkably, a practical catalytic system in these industries
often uses alloys of these metals as catalysts to achieve the
goal of “killing two birds with one stone,” i.e. enhancing the
catalytic efficiency, and in the meantime reducing the
producing costs.45 As evident from this example, the alloying
strategy is a promising approach for preparing novel
nanoparticles with enhanced properties for different types of
catalysis and many other applications.

nanoclusters in order to differentiate them from the
conventional alloy nanoparticles.
(A) From the structural point of view, the unknown surface
structures and unclear metal-organic bonding modes of
nanoparticles limit the fundamental knowledge on the
structure-property correlations.47,48,52 Nanochemists are often
frustrated by the notorious fact that no two nanoparticles are
the same, which precludes the studies on many fundamental
properties of nanoparticles. Benefited from their precisely
characterized structures, ultra-small nanoclusters (typically 1-3
nm in diameter, as depicted in Scheme 1) are capable of
providing an ideal platform for investigating the detailed
mechanism of structure-dependent properties at the atomic
level;47,48,53,54
(B) From the size point of view, nanoclusters with 1-3 nm
diameter can be placed in between metal complexes and
plasmonic metal nanoparticles (Scheme 1). Indeed,
nanoclusters can serve as perfect models of nanoparticles and
establish the bridge from metal complexes to conventional
nanoparticles. For simplicity, we take Au-thiolate (SR)
complexes, Au25(SR)18 and Ag44(SR)30 nanoclusters, and largesized FCC nanoparticles as representatives for molecules,
nanoclusters, and nanoparticles, respectively. Compared to
conventional nanoparticles of which the surface structures are
unclear, nanoclusters can be characterized by single crystal Xray diffraction (SCXRD) and their surface structures have been
determined; for example, the thiolate-protected nanoclusters
comprise a polyhedral metal kernel and various protecting
metal-thiolate motifs.
(C) From the property point of view, strong quantum size
effects in nanoclusters are manifested in their chemical and
physical characteristics such as discrete energy levels of
electrons, multiple absorption bands because of molecular-like
electronic transitions, and so on.46-49 It has been demonstrated
that a slight change in nanoclusters, e.g., adding/subtracting
one electron into/from the nanocluster template, will result in
a non-negligible disturbance on the electronic and geometric
structures, which further influences the properties
remarkably.46-49,55,56 However, in regular nanoparticles,
addition or subtraction of a small number of metal atoms
might not make discernable differences. In addition, compared
with nanoparticles, smaller sizes of nanoclusters endow them
with higher specific surface areas, and consequently distinct
potential for applications in chemical sensing, biology, energy
conversion, catalysis, and so on.47,48,57-61

1.3 Atomically precise alloy nanoclusters

Atomically precise nanoclusters as a special type of
nanoparticles provide great opportunities for researchers to
relate the properties to the well-defined structures, as single
crystals can be grown from such unique nanoparticles and the
crystal structure can be solved by X-ray crystallography (SCXRD).46-51 Of note, they are titled as atomically precise

It is worth a note on the terminology. Doping was originally
used in the semiconductors, whereas alloying is used in
metallurgy. If one starts with a homometal nanocluster,
introducing one or more heterometal atoms is typically called
doping; that is, the starting nanocluster serves as the template,
and the doping process leads to one or multiple atoms of the
parent nanocluster being replaced by atom(s) of another metal,
with the resulting product called a “doped” nanocluster.
Alloying refers to the mixing of different metals in one cluster
framework. Alloy nanoclusters containing two or more

different types of metal atoms do not necessarily correspond
to a parent (i.e. homometal) nanocluster.62 Thus, all doped
nanoclusters belong to alloy nanoclusters, and alloying is a
more general concept than doping. Nevertheless, in the
following discussions, “alloying” and “doping” are used as
interchangeable. “Doping” is more used in specific cases for
“one-on-one” replacement by heteroatom(s) in the parent
nanocluster.
For nanoclusters, we take advantage of their atomically
precise structures to understand the structure-property
correlations, which will guide researchers to customize new
nanoclusters based on the desired performance. As discussed
above, the size, shape, and composition of metal nanoparticles
are the three major factors responsible for the
physicochemical properties.5-7,22-26 Nonetheless, mastering
over the shape and size of nanoclusters might not be enough
for elucidating the relationships between structure and
properties. Since adding/subtracting only one metal atom
into/out of a nanocluster often alters its properties, the
structure-property correlations would better be clarified by
specifying the metal and ligand types, the numbers of metal
atoms and ligands, and structural anatomy. Furthermore,
controlling over the composition of nanoclusters also changes
the chemical/physical properties.
Doping the homo-gold and homo-silver nanoclusters with
heteroatoms has been demonstrated as a versatile approach
to tune their physicochemical performances.47,48 Generally,
doping atom(s) into parent nanoclusters will enhance their
thermal stability and catalytic activity.63,64 In addition, the
electronic structure and optical properties of nanoclusters can
also be tailored by substituting with heterometals.65-71 Owing
to the homologous structures between the parent nanocluster
and its doped ones, insightful correlations between metal
compositions and chemical/physical properties can be mapped
out. Such a goal is however difficult to achieve for large-sized
metal nanoparticles due to the lack of information of atomic
sites and inhomogeneity;
It is inadequate to simply consider the “composition” of
alloy nanoclusters because their chemical/physical properties
are highly dependent on the position(s) that the heteroatom(s)
take in the alloy particle. Of note, the doping modes of
heteroatoms can differ from metal to metal due to their
different electronic and geometric features. Multiple doping
modes in the template, including the central doping, kernel’s
shell doping, and exterior motif doping, pose highly versatile
chemistry for the nanocluster materials (Scheme 2).
In the past years, some reviews related to the
development of nanoclusters have been published, including
those about controllable synthesis and purifications,50,72-83
atomically precise structures and structural evolution
patterns,55,84-109
structure-based
chemical/physical
properties,52,57-61,110-141 and distinct property-dependent
applications.142-157 Besides these reviews, there are also some
overviews touching upon specific topics of experimental and
theoretical works.49,158-169
The main objective of this Review is to summarize the
research achievements and extract the fundamental principles

of alloying in nanoclusters with a focus on the following
aspects.
(A) “Heteroatom doping patterns and structures of alloy
nanocluster” (Sections 2-6) are divided by different
nanocluster templates. Specifically, considering that the
doping mode varies by different heteroatoms and different
nanocluster templates, we divide alloy nanoclusters into five
categories, including alloying in homo-gold nanocluster
templates (Section 2), alloying in homo-silver nanocluster
templates (Section 3), alloy nanoclusters of specific magic sizes
(Section 4), alloy nanoclusters with multi-metallic compositions
(Section 5), and other alloy nanoclusters without specific
homo-metal template (Section 6). The alloying principles and
fundamentals are discussed in each section.

Scheme 2 The doping tree of metal nanoclusters. Doping
heteroatom(s) into different templates follows distinct doping
modes, which increases the structural/compositional diversity
of metal nanoclusters.
(B) As alloying has been proved to be a versatile strategy in
improving their chemical and physical performances, alloy
nanoclusters constitute a platform for investigating intermetallic synergism at atomic level. Section 7 includes an
overview of their optical, electrochemical, magnetic, and chiral
properties, as well as their stability and reactivity. In addition,
atomically precise structure-property correlations are
summarized.
(C) Alloy nanoclusters exhibit largely improved
physicochemical performances relative to corresponding
homo-metallic nanoclusters, which benefit the applications of
cluster-based nanomaterials. The Section 8 discusses catalysis,
sensing, bio-labelling, bio-imaging, biomedicine, and energy
conversion based on alloy nanoclusters.

In the end, we provide perspectives and highlight the
challenges for future researches on alloy nanoclusters (Section
9). For instance, precise control over alloying sites, diversity in
atomically precise alloying processes, limitation for metalexchange in nanoclusters, and new applications for alloy
nanoclusters.
In summary, this Review summarize research progress in
the syntheses of alloy nanoclusters with controllable
compositions, X-ray crystallographic determination of doping
sites, and effects of doping on the optical, electronic, magnetic,
electrochemical and catalytic properties. Besides, the intermetallic synergies derived from alloy nanocluster systems are
discussed, which will guide researchers in designing new alloy
nanomaterials with tailored functionality.

synthesized Au25(SR)18 (e.g., metal-exchange/anti-galvanic
reduction), inter-cluster reactions, and so on. Interestingly,
different alloying outcomes occur from these approaches. For
example, the Pd1Au24 or Pt1Au24 nanocluster can only be
prepared by in-situ synthesis via reducing Pd-SR/Au-SR or PtSR/Au-SR complexes,63,64 while Au22Ir3(SR)18 can only be
prepared by inter-cluster reaction.173

The systems of homo-metal nanoclusters and their derivatives,
e.g. Au25(SR)18 and MxAu25-x(SR)18 (M = Ag/Cu/Pt/Pd/Cd/Hg)
nanoclusters, make it possible to map out the inter-metal
synergisms at the atomic level, which is of great significance in
the field of nanoscience. Understanding synergetic effects
would instruct the preparation of novel alloy nanoclusters with
tailored chemical/physical properties.
The synthetic methods of alloy nanoclusters can be mainly
classified into two categories: (i) chemical reduction of a
mixture of ligated metal complexes (such as Au-SR/Ag-SR
complexes); (ii) doping the homo-metal nanoclusters with
hetero-metal salts or complexes. For example, either coreducing Au-SR/Ag-SR complexes or doping Aun(SR)m with AgSR generates Aun-xAgx(SR)m alloy nanoclusters.
This section summarizes the alloying of heterometals into
gold nanoclusters, mainly including the icosahedral Au25, the
bi-icosahedral Au38, the FCC/HCP Au nanoclusters (Au18, Au21,
Au23, Au36), the small-sized Au:PPh3 nanoclusters (Au9-13:PPh3),
the nanoclusters in the form of “cluster of clusters” (rod-like
Au25, Au37 and Au38 capped by PPh3), and the large-sized Au144
nanocluster. Of note, doping based on Au25(SR)18, Au38(SR)24,
and Au25(PPh)10(SR)5Cl2 templates is reviewed elsewhere when
this Review is under preparation.81

2.1 Alloying in icosahedral Au25(SR)18 template
Since the early synthesis of Au25(SR)18 in 1998 and successful
structural determination in 2008,170,171,172 it has stimulated
great interest because of its ease of preparation, high yield,
thermal stability, and versatile surface functionalization, as
well as broad applications.166,167 Au25(SR)18 possesses an
icosahedral Au13 kernel, which is protected by six SR-Au-SR-AuSR staple motifs in a quasi-octahedral symmetry.171,172 This
nanocluster has acted as a template for diverse alloying works
and is perhaps the most widely studied system. So far, rich
types of hetero-metals, including Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Hg, Cd, Ir, etc.,
have been successfully doped into the Au25(SR)18 template
(Table 1), and several synthetic methods were developed,
including in-situ syntheses (co-reduction), doping of pre-

Fig. 2 Doping sites of heteroatom(s) in Au25(SR)18 template. (a) Structural anatomy of the Au25(SR)18 nanocluster. Structures of (b)
Au25-xAgx(SR)18 nanoclusters with increasing doping degree. Of note, both “in-situ synthesis” (top) and “metal exchange”
(bottom) approaches can direct the synthesis of Au25-xAgx(SR)18 alloy nanoclusters. Structures of (c) Au25-xCux(SR)18 and Au25xCux(SeR)18 nanoclusters. (d) Other heteroatom(s)-doped Au25-xMx(SR)18 nanoclusters, including Pd1Au24(SR)18, Pt1Au24(SR)18,
Au24Cd1(SR)18 Au24Hg1(SR)18, and Au22Ir3(SR)18.
Because of the different properties of hetero-metals,
different doping modes in the Au25(SR)18 template are
observed, i.e., heterometals in different doping sites and
degrees of doping. The mono-heteroatom doping mode is
associated with Pt, Pd, Hg, and Cd,63,64,71,171-176 while three Ir
atoms could be introduced into Au25(SR)18.173 The Ag and Cu
dopants are more complicated. As for Ag-doped M25(SR)18
nanoclusters, (i) the number of Ag heteroatoms in Au25(SR)18
can be easily controlled by regulating the Au/Ag ratios in
synthetic procedures;65,66,174,177,178 (ii) the incorporated Ag
heteroatoms can go from the icosahedral kernel to the
surface structure;179 that is, only the center Au is nonswappable. As for Cu-doped M25(SR)18 nanoclusters, no
crystal structure of Au25-xCux(SR)18 has been obtained yet, but
it is evidenced by extensive experiments that Cu should
substitute the Au atom(s) on staple motifs. In this section,
doped nanoclusters based on the Au25(SR)18 template are
reviewed, including the synthetic procedures and doping
modes.
Au25-xAgx(SR)18 alloy nanoclusters have been successfully
prepared via several methods (Fig. 1), including (i) in-situ
syntheses by co-reducing Au-SR/Ag-SR complexes;65,66,177,180182 (ii) reactions between Au (SR)

reactions between Au25(SR)18 and Ag nanoclusters.189-193

Methods (i)/(ii): Early in 2010, Au25-xAgx(SR)18 nanoclusters
with continuously modulated x were synthesized, albeit with
different procedures ― in-situ synthesis by Negishi et al.,65
and reacting Au25(SR)18 with Ag+ ions by Murray et al.183 The
structures of Au25-xAgx(SR)18 nanoclusters prepared by in-situ
synthesis with increasing doping degrees are shown in Fig. 2b.
The Ag-doping process and synergistic effect between Au and
Ag enable the doped nanoclusters to display differences and
tunability in optical and catalytic properties, as well as the
reactivity for ligand-exchange reactions, which are discussed
in Section 7.54,181,194,195 By concomitantly reducing the Au-SR
and Ag-SR complexes, the Xie group developed a series of
hydrophilic Au25-xAgx nanoclusters protected by mono- and
bi-thiolate ligands.182 In their work, the compositions of both
the Au/Ag kernel and the ligand shell could be tailored by
regulating the feeding ratios of Au/Ag precursors and
different ligands, which further enriched the functionalities of
alloy nanoclusters.182
Methods (iii): Bulk metals display galvanic-replacement
performance, which was utilized to prepare metal
nanoparticles with controllable sizes, shapes, and
configurations.196-198 For example, typical galvanic reactions
are as follow,
Ag NPs + HAuCl4 (or Pt, Pd salts)  Ag/M alloy NPs
However, in the size regime of nanoclusters, different
alloying manners emerge due to the molecular behavior of
nanoclusters as opposed to bulk-metal behavior. It was

surprisingly found that ions of more active metals (e.g. AgI or
CuI) can replace Au0 atoms in the cluster to produce M0 (Ag0
or Cu0) atoms.186 To gain a deeper understanding on this
interesting behavior, the Zhu group developed a versatile
approach to synthesizing alloy nanoclusters containing both
high- and low-activity metals.174 With this “metal exchange”
method, doped M25 nanoclusters including Au25-xAgx(SR)18,
Au25-xCux(SR)18, Au24Cd1(SR)18 and Au24Hg1(SR)18 were
obtained. The structure of Au25-xAgx(SR)18 nanoclusters
prepared by metal-exchange with increasing doping degrees
is shown in Fig. 2b. More significantly, “metal exchange” is
reversible in these alloy systems: i.e., AgI can substitute Au0
atoms in Au25, and Ag0 in Au25-xAgx can be reversibly
exchanged back by AuI, with the reaction equilibrium as:
Au25(SR)18 + x Ag(I)-SR → Au25-xAgx(SR)18 + x Au(I)-SR;
Au25-xAgx(SR)18 + x Au(I)-SR → Au25(SR)18 + x Ag(I)-SR.
Considering that all these surviving nanoclusters exhibit
delocalized electron shell closing (DESC) of 8e (superatom
rule),199 Wang et al. rationalize that the “metal exchange”
method should be associated with electron shell closing and
stability of the obtained alloy nanoclusters, but be less
related to metal activity.174 Some follow-up works were
performed on simultaneously doping Ag and exchanging
foreign-thiolates into the Au25(SR)18 nanocluster.185
Methods (iv): The Wu group presented an AGR strategy to
make alloy nanoclusters.184,186,187,200 In their works, the
reactions between Au25(SR)18 nanoclusters and Ag/Cu
nanoparticles introduced the heteroatoms into the Au25
template, which was an opposite process to the galvanic
reaction.186,187 The concept of AGR is also exploited to
synthesize atomically precise Au25Ag2(SR)18 via the reaction
between Au25(SR)18 and AgNO3, where the additional Ag
atoms are collocated on Au25.184
Methods (v): Inter-cluster reactions were developed for
preparing alloy nanoclusters.173,189-193 The Pradeep group
meticulously explored the inter-cluster reactions between
Au25(SR)18 and a series of Ag nanoclusters, such as Ag25(SR)18,
Ag44(SR)30, and Ag51(S2R)19(PPh3)3. For instance, reacting
Au25(SR)18 with Ag44(SR)30 produced Au25-xAgx(SR)18 and Ag44yAuy(SR)30 alloy nanoclusters (no exact relationship between x
and y).189 The inter-cluster reaction between Au25(SR)18 and
Ag25(SR)18 not only generated Au25-xAgx(SR)18 (x = 1-24), but a
dianionic adduct—Au25(SR)18Ag25(SR’)18—was detected as
well by the electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS).190 Of note, regulating the feeding ratios of Au25(SR)18
and homo-silver nanoclusters enabled controlling the Ag
doping degrees in final products.191-193 Theoretical results
illustrated that (i) the Ag heteroatoms in Au25-xAgx(SR)18
tended to occupy the sites on the icosahedral kernel’s shell,
and (ii) the Au heteroatoms in Ag44-yAuy(SR)30 would
substitute the Ag atoms in the icosahedral Ag12 kernel.191,192
In the follow-up work, Ir heteroatoms were doped into
Au25(SR)18 through an inter-cluster reaction between
Au25(SR)18 and Ir9(SR)6 nanoclusters.173 DFT calculations
illustrated the optimal structure of Au22Ir3(SR)18 in which
three Ir heteroatoms were arranged triangularly with one Ir

at the center and the other two on the M13 kernel’s shell (Fig.
2d).173
Ag-doping: The structure of Au25-xAgx(SR)18 was
determined by Dass and co-workers in 2014.66 Single-crystal
X-ray crystallography (SC-XRD) revealed a tri-stratified
arrangement―Au1@Au5.3Ag6.7@6×Au2(SR)3 (Fig. 2b, uppermiddle). The center and the motifs are exclusively occupied
by Au atoms, whereas Ag heteroatoms selectively take the
twelve sites of the icosahedral kernel’s surface.66 However,
Ag dopants are later discovered not to be limited to the
kernel shell. By using cyclohexanethiol (HS-c-C6H11), heavilydoped Au25-xAgx(SR)18 nanoclusters with average x = 20.45
were prepared.177,179 The maximum number of Ag dopants
was determined to be 24 by ESI-MS analysis.177,179 SC-XRD
results suggested that, except the center Au atom, all the
other Au atoms in the parent Au25 could be substituted by Ag
(Fig. 2b, upper-right).
Both moderately-doped Ag6.7Au18.3(SR)18 and heavilydoped Ag20.45Au4.55(SR)18 nanoclusters were prepared by an
in-situ procedure.66,177 Structurally, when protected by SC2H4Ph or SC12H25 ligand, Ag heteroatoms are restricted on
the M12 kernel shell.65,66 Even with a large Ag/Au ratio in the
precursor, the obtained Au25-xAgx(SR)18 nanoclusters can
hardly support more than twelve silver atoms in the
template.65 By comparison, heavily-doped Au1Ag24(SR)18
nanoclusters can be achieved with the help of HS-c-C6H11.177
Such a phenomenon was also observed in Au25-xAgx(SR)18
nanoclusters synthesized by metal-exchange metheds.174,179
Metal-exchanging of Au25(S-C2H4Ph)18 with Ag(I)-(S-C2H4Ph)
introduced up to 12 Ag atoms into the M25(S-C2H4Ph)18
template.174 By comparison, up to 19 silver atoms were
doped into M25(S-c-C6H11)18 by reacting Au23(S-c-C6H11)16 with
Ag(I)-(S-c-C6H11), and some staple motif sites were exclusively
occupied by Ag.179 All of these results indicate the important
effects of ligands on the doping processes.
Cu-doping: Au25-xCux nanoclusters can be synthesized by
in-situ synthesis,67,68,180,181,201,202 metal-exchange,174 and AGR
methods.187 Ligand effects were also observed in Au25-xCux
alloy nanoclusters (Fig. 2c).67,68 The Au25-xCux(SR)18 showed a
spontaneous de-alloying process over time, and the initially
prepared bimetal nanoclusters would convert back to
Au25(SR)18 (such a phenomenon was not observed in Agdoped M25).67,201 For comparison, selenolate-capped Au2568 Another
xCux(SeR)18 nanoclusters exhibited high stability.
difference lies in the Cu doping number. As for Au25-xCux(SR)18,
a maximum of four Cu heteroatoms can be introduced;67,201
whereas in Au25-xCux(SeR)18 with selenolate, up to 9 Cu atoms
can be introduced (Fig. 2c).68 It should be noted that no
structure of Cu-doped M25 is accessible so far. In order to
determine the preferential doping sites of Cu in the
Au25(SR)18 template, several means have been performed, e.g.
DFT calculations, and EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption
spectroscopy).201,202 Specifically, DFT calculations suggested
that the optimal doping site in Au24Cu1(SR)18 is the
icosahedral surface. However, EXAFS results demonstrated
that the single Cu should occupy the staple site, i.e. Au2(SR)3
staple motifs.202 The discrepancy between DFT and EXAFS

was explained in terms of the difference in the chemical
durability of the Cu dopant at various sites against
oxidation.202
Pt/Pd-doping: Mono-Pt- or Pd-doped M1Au24(SR)18
nanoclusters were well-studied in the last ten years, mainly
because
of
their
capability
in
tuning
the
electronic/geometrical structures and chemical/physical
properties of Au25(SR)18.63,64,203-222 Of note, doping a Pt/Pd
heteroatom into the Au25(SR)18 template was only achieved
by in-situ synthesis, and mass spectra demonstrated that only
one heteroatom was allowed in M25 no matter what Pd/Au or
Pt/Au ratio was,63,203-208,214 which is different from the doping
of Ag and Cu. High-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) was exploited to separate/purify the prepared
M1Au24(SR)18 from its mixture with Au25(SR)18.204-208 With the
pure M1Au24(SR)18, changes on chemical/physical properties
introduced by the Pd/Pt-doping have been thoroughly
investigated, including thermal stability,204 reactivity,205,206
catalytic performance,63,64,217-219 magnetism,216 and excitedstate behavior220,221 (see more details in Section 7). In early
studies, several means, e.g. DFT calculations and EXAFS
measurements, were performed to determine the doping site
of Pd/Pt, and all evidence suggested the center
occupation.63,209,211-215 Such results also demonstrated that
the doped Pt/Pd would significantly affect the electronic
structure of the parent Au25(SR)18 nanocluster. Kwak et al.
presented the interconversion of Pd1Au24(SR)18 or
Pt1Au24(SR)18 between superatomic 6-electron and 8-electron
configurations ([M1Au24(SR)18]0 and [M1Au24(SR)18]2-, M =
Pd/Pt), and attributed the variations in electronic and
geometric structures to Jahn—Teller-like distortion of the 6electron nanoclusters,211 which is reminiscent of a similar
effect in different-charged Au25(SR)18q (q = -1, 0, +1).212 Sels et
al. investigated the structures of M1Au24 nanoclusters costabilized by mono-thiol and di-thiol ligands, indicating the dithiol would bridge the apex S and one core S of two adjacent
Au2(SR)3 motifs.213
The X-ray structures of Pd1Au24(SR)18 and Pt1Au24(SR)18
nanoclusters (both charge-neutral) were reported in
2016,210,216 further verifying the center-doping mode of Pd/Pt
heteroatom in Au25(SR)18 (Fig. 2d). SC-XRD suggested slightly
oblate M13 kernels induced by Pd/Pt doping.210,216
In 2019, Tsukuda and co-workers reported the crystal
structures of negatively charged [Pt1Au24(SR)18]- and
[Pt1Au24(SR)18]2-.222 Specifically, the stoichiometric production
of open shell [Pt1Au24(SR)18]- (7e) was achieved by reaction
between an equal amount of [Pt1Au24(SR)18]0 and
[Pt1Au24(SR)18]2-, that is, electron transfer from [Pt1Au24]2- to
[Pt1Au24]0:
[Pt1Au24]2- + [Pt1Au24]0 → [Pt1Au24]- + [Pt1Au24]-.222
The reaction between [HM1Au8(PPh3)8]+ (M = Pt/Pd) and
Au(I)-SC2H4Ph or Au(I)-C≡CAr (Ar = 3,5-(CF3)2Ph) offered
[M1Au24(SC2H4Ph)18]0 (with a (M1Au12)6+ kernel) or
[M1Au24(C≡CAr)18]2- (with a (M1Au12)4+ kernel) alloy
nanoclusters.221 [M1Au24(C≡CAr)18]2- is the doping counterpart
of the reported homo-gold [Au25(C≡CAr)18]-.222 The larger
number of valence electrons in the (M1Au12)4+ kernel

protected by alkynyl was ascribed to the increase of
attractive potential owing to the stronger electronwithdrawing nature of alkynyl relative to thiolates. Of note,
reacting HPt1Au8(PPh3)8 with the Au(I)-S-c-C6H11 complexs
resulted in Pt1Au24(S-c-C6H11)18, whereas the addition of Au(I)S-c-C6H11 to HPd1Au8(PPh3)8 yielded new Pd1Au23(S-c-C6H11)17
with its structure being composed of a flattened (Pd1Au12)6+
kernel, three Au1(SR)2 staples, one Au2(SR)3 staple, and two
Au3(SR)4 staples.223
Cd/Hg-doping: Aside from Pt- and Pd-doped M1Au24(SR)18
alloys, the single-heteroatom doping mode has also been
found in Cd- and Hg-doped M25(SR)18 nanoclusters.71,174,175
The doping site of the single Hg/Cd heteroatom is however
still controversial (i.e. staple site, icosahedral center or
shell).71,175 Interestingly, Au24Cd1 can be transformed to
Au24Hg1 (within 1 min) after the addition of 1 eq. Hg2+;
however, the reversible process was not successful.175 DFT
calculations showed that the reaction Cd1Au24(SR)18 + Hg2+ →
Hg1Au24(SR)18 + Cd2+ was favorable (G = -3.5 kcal/mol).175
The number and location(s) of foreign-metal atom(s) in
the Au25(SR)18 template aforementioned were determined by
mass spectrometry and SC-XRD. Maran and co-workers used
a combination of NMR, isotope analysis, MALDI-MS,
electrochemistry, and SC-XRD to analyze the alloying
positions and found that Pt or Pd heteroatom is at the center
of Au25(SR)18, whereas Cd or Hg heteroatom is doped into the
icosahedral kernel’s surface.176 The alloying results are not
dependent on the thiols, the metal salts/complexes used in
the syntheses, or the synthetic methods.176 Thus,
supplementary characterization along with SC-XRD is
required when determining the doping position(s) in alloy
nanoclusters when the electron-density difference between
Au and heteroatom(s), i.e. Pt/Hg, is very small. The X-ray
absorption spectroscopy analysis is quite conclusive.63
Theoretical calculations: Many theoretical works have
been performed to obtain the information of (i) doping sites
and (ii) doping effects based on the Au25(SR)18
template.63,71,174,178,190,192, 211,225-231 Early in 2009, Walter and
Moseler reported the optimal structures of mono Ag-, Cd-, or
Pd-doped M25(SR)18 nanoclusters.225 Considering that
[Au25(SR)18]- features a magic number of 8 free electrons
(superatom), Jiang and Dai surveyed many elements as
potential central doping atom candidates, and their results
indicated that the 8-electron count rule based on superatom
concept was powerful for M@Au24(SR)18q predictions.226 The
Häkkinen group presented that [Pd1Au24(SR)18]2- was a 8electron closed-shell species, whereas [Pd1Au24(SR)18]z
nanoclusters (-1 ≤ z ≤ +3) held holes in superatom 1P HOMO
manifold, indicating that the Pd dopant contributes no
electron to the delocalized electron density in the kernel.227
In the theoretical works based on Au25-xAgx(SR)18 nanoclusters,
it is demonstrated that the Ag dopants tend to maintain an
average distribution on the icosahedral surfacewhich
possesses the lowest thermodynamic energy and the highest
stability.178,228,230 In 2018, a “thermodynamic stability model”
was proposed to explain the preference in heteroatom

doping position(s) by relating the metal core cohesive energy
to the shell-to-core binding energy.231
Collectively, a number of heteroatoms can be doped into
the Au25(SR)18 template with different doping degrees and
doping positions: Ag, Cu, or Ir follows a multiple-heteroatom
doping mode, whereas Pd, Pt, Cd, or Hg adopts the monodoping mode. The Pd or Pt takes the central position, and Ag,
Cd, or Hg prefers the kernel’s surface, whereas Cu might be
on the staple motifs. The different preferential doping
manners of heteroatoms could be caused by their different
electron configurations, atomic sizes, electronegativity,
surface energy, etc. Interestingly, different doping
approaches enable Au25-xMx(SR)18 alloy nanoclusters with
diverse doping degrees and doping sites. In addition,
different ligands of –SR might also have some important
influences on the doping manners. Another intriguing
phenomenon is that Pt- and Pd-doped M1Au24(SR)18
nanoclusters can only be prepared by in-situ synthesis
procedures. Future works should focus on the root that
causes such diversity, and mechanistic understanding on
alloying should still be pursued.

Specifically, the Au/Ag exchangeable positions are located at
the middle three positions (the shared triangular plane), and
the top/bottom two triangles of the Au23 kernel, resulting in
Au2@Au17.04Ag3.96@3×Au(SR)2&6×Au2(SR)3.249 The kernel shell
sites that can be doped with Ag might be related to the
different coordination, and Ag atoms tend to take the
positions which are more likely to transfer charge to staple
Au or S atoms.

2.2 Alloying in bi-icosahedral Au38(SR)24 template
As with Au25(SR)18, Au38(SR)24 is also one of the classical and
most researched nanoclusters owing to its high stability, rodshaped structure and intriguing properties, especially
chirality.232-245 Although several other Au38 nanoclusters with
different capping ligands and structures have been
reported,246-248 doping has only been accomplished on the
classical Au38(SR)24 nanocluster (Table 2).

The homo-gold Au38(SR)24 contains a bi-icosahedral Au23
kernel, which is capped by three monomeric Au(SR)2 staples
and six dimeric Au2(SR)3 staple motifs, Fig. 3a. Such a biicosahedral kernel can be viewed as two icosahedral Au13
kernels fused at a common Au3 plane.
Ag-doping: The structure of Au38-xAgx(SR)24 (average x =
3.96) is determined to be the same as its parent cluster.249
Although the MALDI-MS spectra indicated that up to 10 Ag
heteroatoms can be incorporated into the Au38(SR)24
template, no crystal structures of heavily-Ag-doped Au38250-253 which might due to the
xAgx(SR)24 are accessible yet,
enhanced nanocluster surface flexibility along with the
increased Ag-doping degree.253 As for the doping modes, the
introduced Ag heteroatoms preferentially take the biicosahedral kernel’s surface sites (Fig. 3a, bottom-left).

Ag/Cu) nanoclusters. (b) Structures of homo-gold Au38(SR)24
and proposed structures of corresponding Pd2Au36(SR)24 and

The dynamic behavior for doping Au38(SR)24 into Ag38xAgx(SR)24 (SR = butanethiolate) in solution via adding Ag(I)-SR
complexes was investigated by Negishi et al.254 Although ESI-

MS spectra suggested that the chemical composition of the
doped clusters remains unchanged after Ag38-xAgx(SR)18
nanoclusters were obtained, continuously undergoing intercluster metal exchange was still implied by HPLC results. The
frequency of the inter-cluster metal exchange was inversely
proportional to the standing time of reaction, while such a
phenomenon was absent if Ag38-xAgx(SR)24 nanoclusters were
directly synthesized (co-reducing Au-SR/Ag-SR complexes).
The reason for the inter-cluster metal exchange was
proposed to be the presence of structural isomers of Ag38254
xAgx(SR)24.
Cu-doping: With an in-situ two-phase ligand-exchange
approach, Au38-xCux(SR)24 (x = 1-6) alloy nanoclusters were
prepared and structurally determined.255 Of note, the

stabilizer
in
Au38-xCux(SR)24
is
2,4-DMBT
(2,4dimethylbenzenethiol), which is different from HS-C2H4Ph in
Au38-xAgx(SR)24.249 Interestingly, Cu heteroatoms are only
found in the six dimeric motifs to form -SR-M-SR-M-SR- (M =
Au/Cu) units (Fig. 3a, bottom-right). The different doping
modes of Ag (exclusively kernel shell doping) and Cu
(exclusively dimeric motif doping) probably result from the
different electronic structures of these heteroatoms, the
much smaller size of Cu compared to Ag and Au, etc. ESI-MS
suggested that up to six Cu heteroatoms could be doped into
the nanocluster template, with the strongest signal
corresponding
to
Cu3Au35(SR)24.
However,
SC-XRD
demonstrated an average 0.996 of Cu, which was much less
than the MS result,255 which might be due to the less stability
of multi-doped nanoclusters as we observed in the case of
Au18-xAgx(SR)14. For the latter system, the initial MS spectrum
showed signals for Au14Ag4 and Au13Ag5 co-existent with
Au15Ag3, but the former two components slowly faded out
during the crystallization process due to their lower
stability.256 Thus, a similar phenomenon might exist in Au38xCux(SR)24 nanoclusters as well. In terms of the doping effect
on optical properties, because Cu heteroatoms contribute
little to the frontier molecular orbitals of the nanocluster
according to DFT calculations, its optical absorption is similar
to that of homo-gold Au38(SR)24.255
Kazan et al. found that a Cu heteroatom can be captured
by Au38(SR)24 onto its surface, producing Cu1Au38(SR)24.257
HPLC was used to separate Cu1Au38 from the mixture, and the
circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of chiral Cu1Au38 was
distinctively different from that of its Au38 homologue,
revealing a variation in electronic structure due to copper
addition.257 Such a metal-ion capture was also found in
Au25Ag2(SR)18 as mentioned in Section 2.1 [see the method
(iv)].184
Pt/Pd-doping: Mono-Pd or Pt can be introduced at the
center position of the icosahedral kernel in Au25(SR)18 (see
section 2.1). Similarly, center-occupation of Pd heteroatoms
in the bi-icosahedral kernel is theoretically suggested for the
alloyed Pd2Au36(SR)24 nanocluster.258 Comparative tests
between homo-gold Au38 and doped Pd2Au36 nanoclusters
demonstrated that Pd-doping had significant effects on the
electronic structure of M38 nanoclusters, which could further
enhance the chemical/physical properties, such as thermal
stability and surface flexibility.258-262 Unfortunately, crystal
structures of M2Au36(SR)24 (M = Pd/Pt) nanoclusters have not
been obtained, and thus, other means have been performed
to determine the doping sites of Pt/Pd dopants, including
theoretical analysis, XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy)
and EXAFS spectroscopy,260-262 but all indicate the centerdoping mode in M2Au36(SR)24 (Fig. 3b).260-263
Collectively, in the doped M38(SR)24, the introduced Ag
heteroatoms are exclusively doped into the 9 specific sites of
bi-icosahedral kernel shell; whereas some of the motif Au
atoms can be replaced by Cu with the homo-gold kernel is
preserved. However, only slight Ag- or Cu-doping has been
achieved in M38 nanoclusters. Information on moderately to
heavily-doped Au38-xMx(SR)24 nanoclusters is highly desired,

which might provide an opportunity to further illustrate (i)
the gradual heteroatom doping processes and (ii) structureproperty correlations at the atomic level. Furthermore, there
are many relationships between Au38(SR)24 and Au25(SR)18 in
terms of kernel configuration, motif structure, and the fusion
transformation;107,264 thus, it would be interesting to see if
the doped M25(SR)18 can fuse into M38(SR)24 in a similar way
as their parent clusters do.264 Moreover, doping other
heteroatoms, e.g., Cd and Hg, into the Au38(SR)24 template
has not been reported yet, and neither has the ligand study
been attempted. Considering that Au38(SR)24 nanoclusters can
be prepared by different stabilizers (e.g., S-C2H4Ph, S-Ph, SePh,232,235,236 it remains unknown whether Au38-xMx(SR)24 alloy
nanoclusters display ligand-dependent alloying behavior or
not. This deserves to be pursued in future work.
2.3 Alloying based on FCC/HCP Au templates
In sections 2.1 and 2.2, the doping modes in icosahedral
nanoclusters have been highlighted, and one would wonder
whether alloying based on FCC/HCP (FCC: face-centered
cubic; HCP: hexagonal closest packed) templates would be
different or not. In this section, alloying based on HCP
Au18(SR)14, FCC Au21(SR)15, FCC Au23(SR)16, FCC Au36(SR)24
templates are highlighted. The doping mode indeed varies in
nanocluster templates of different structure types.
2.3.1 Alloying based on HCP Au18(SR)14 nanocluster template
Au18(SR)14 contains a bi-octahedral HCP Au9 kernel, which is
protected by three Au1(SR)2 motifs, one Au2(SR)3 motif, and
one Au4(SR)5 motif (Fig. 4a).265,266 So far, two crystal
structures of Au18-xAgx(SR)14 nanoclusters have been
reported: Au15Ag3(S-c-C6H11)14 and Au15Ag3(S-PhMe2)14.256,267
These two Au15Ag3(SR)14 nanoclusters were obtained by
different synthetic methods: (i) Au15Ag3(S-c-C6H11)14 was
prepared by combining in-situ synthetic and ligand-exchange
methods. Specifically, (AuAg)n(SG)m (H-SG = glutathione) were
initially prepared, and then the SG ligands were replaced by
S-c-C6H11 ligands via a two-phase ligand-exchange method;267
(ii) the Au15Ag3(S-PhMe2)14 was produced by a metalexchange method, in which Au18(S-PhMe2)14 was first
prepared by ligand-exchanging hydrophilic Au18(SG)14 with
excess HS-PhMe2, and then Ag(I)-SPhMe2 was added to the
solution of as-prepared Au18(S-PhMe2)14 to prepare the
alloy.256
Crystal structures of both Au15Ag3 nanoclusters (capped
by S-c-C6H11 or S-PhMe2) demonstrate that the three Ag
heteroatoms locate at the center triangle of the M9 kernel,
i.e., the Au9 kernel with Au3-Au3-Au3 constitution is doped
into an Au3-Ag3-Au3 constitution in Au15Ag3(SR)14 (Fig. 4a).
Although the final Ag doping numbers in crystal states for
both alloy nanoclusters and the kernel structures are the
same, some differences are apparent:
(i) The as-prepared products prepared by metal-exchanging
Au18(S-PhMe2)14 with Ag(I)-SPhMe2 included Au15Ag3, Au14Ag4,
and Au13Ag5. But only Au15Ag3 survived after repeated
crystallization due to its distinctly higher stability.256

(ii) The atomic arrangements in the two Au15Ag3 structures
are different, including the different kernel orientation and
the motif structure orientations. Such differences induce the
red-shifted optical absorption (by ~25 nm) and reduced
optical gap (by ~0.15 eV) when comparing the UV-vis spectra
of Au15Ag3(S-PhMe2)14 and Au15Ag3(S-c-C6H11)14.267
(iii) Enhanced thermal-stability accompanied by Ag doping
has been proved in the Au18(S-PhMe2)14-to-Au15Ag3(SPhMe2)14 doping process,256 and the enhanced stability might
result from the Au-Ag inter-metallic synergism effects.
However, in the S-c-C6H11 stabilized system, the stability of
Au15Ag3 was much lower than the homo-gold Au18
nanocluster. DFT calculations were carried out based on the
displacement reaction of Au18(S-c-C6H11)14 + 3 Ag →
Au15Ag3(S-c-C6H11)14 + 3 Au. The calculated heat of reaction is
0.41 eV, demonstrating that Au15Ag3(S-c-C6H11)14 displays
relatively lower stability than Au18(S-c-C6H11)14.267 Therefore,
the different thermal-stability observed in different thiolatestabilized Au18-Au15Ag3 systems can be understood by the
ligand effect, which also induces slight structural changes and
optical absorption variations between the two Au15Ag3(SR)14
nanoclusters.256

The Ag doping process in hydrophilic Au18(SG)14
nanocluster is remarkably different from that in hydrophobic
Au18(SR)14. Yu et al. reported an efficient synthesis of alloyed
Au18-xAgx(SG)14 nanoclusters by the carbon monoxide (CO)
reducing method.268 The metal compositions of the final
doped products could be rationally tuned by adjusting the
Ag/Au ratio in the precursor. Specifically, (i) Au18(SG)14 was
prepared from the Au(I)-SG complex; (ii) up to six Au atoms in
the Au9 kernel could be substituted by incoming Ag
heteroatoms when Au/Ag ratio = 0.5, and increasing the
Ag/Au ratio would increase the Ag doping number in Au18xAgx(SG)14; (iii) when the Ag/Au ratio is over 0.75, no
M18(SG)14 was generated, and only complexes were detected,
such as Au1Ag1(SG)2, Au1Ag2(SG)2, and Au4Ag3(SG)5 complexes.
Consequently, Yu et al. proposed that the center Au3 triangle
was significant to maintain the M18(SG)14 nanoclusters, and
the template would collapse when more than six Au atoms
were substituted.268 Moreover, it is proposed that hydrophilic
Au18(SG)14 should have an Ag3-Au3-Ag3 sequence in the
kernel,268 opposite to the Au3-Ag3-Au3 sequence in
hydrophobic M18(SR)14. This work demonstrates once again
the ligand effect on the doping process.268
It is also possible to have Au18-xAgx(SR)14 (x ≥ 7). Molina et
al. theoretically explored the preferred Ag doping sites in
Au18-xAgx(SR)14 (1 ≤ x ≤ 10).269 Specifically, the first three Ag
heteroatoms prefer to substitute the central Au3 triangle,
consistent with the experiments.256,267 The fourth and fifth Ag
heteroatoms tend to occupy the separated locations in the
other two Au3 plates on either side. When the Ag doping
number reaches seven, an Ag3-Ag3-Ag1Au2 kernel is obtained.
Then, all of the nine positions in the kernel will be replaced.
DFT calculations revealed that the synergistic effects between
Au and Ag disturbed the optical and chiroptical properties of
M18(SR)14 nanoclusters, depending on the number of
incorporated Ag heteroatoms.269
Doping Ag into Au18(SR)14 would remarkably affect the
electronic structure of the nanocluster owing to the Au-Ag
synergetic effect,269 which would further affect the
performance of nanoclusters in chemical reactions such as
the ligand-exchange process. Ligand-exchange on Au18(SC6H11)14 with 1-adamantanethiol (HS-Adm) produces an
Au21(S-Adm)15 nanocluster, following a size-growth mode.270
Interestingly, Kang et al. demonstrated that the single-Agdoped Au18 nanocluster, i.e., Au17Ag1(S-C6H11)14, would
profoundly change the outcomes, giving rise to Au16Ag1(SAdm)13 with a decreased size (Fig. 4b).271 The crystal structure
of Au16Ag1 exhibits an Au6Ag1 kernel protected by one
dimeric and two tetrameric motifs. Such a comparison
illustrates that the Au3-Au2Ag1-Au3 kernel of Au17Ag1
transforms into an Au1-Au2Ag1-Au3 kernel in Au16Ag1, and the
position of Ag atom maintains in this size-transformation
process.271 In order to reveal the fundamental cause of the
differences in ligand-exchange processes, Vienna ab initio
simulation package (VASP) was employed to perform the
charge analysis on these two nanoclusters.271 Results show
that the heterogeneous distribution of charge density around

the Ag in Au17Ag1 comparing to that around the
corresponding gold in Au18 was proposed as the fundamental
reason.270,271
The Ag heteroatoms can also be used to bridge small
Au(I)-thiolate motifs of Au18(SR)14, in which no Au atom in
Au18(SR)14 is substituted.272,273 Xie and co-workers reported
using Ag+ to link Au(I)-SG staple motifs, producing Au18@Ag
nanoclusters.272 The formation of large Au(I)/Ag(I)-SG staple
motif on the surface was suggested as the reason for
remarkably enhanced photoluminescence (PL) of Au18@Ag
nanoclusters (quantum yield (QY) = 6.8%) via aggregationinduced emission (AIE), compared to the weakly emissive
Au18(SG)14 nanocluster (QY = 0.37%). Such a method was also
exploited for tailoring the PL properties of Au15(SG)13 and
Au25(SG)18 nanoclusters.272 In their latter work, the excited
state dynamics of Au@Ag nanoclusters (including Au15@Ag,
Au18@Ag, and Au25@Ag) were studied by time-resolved
transient absorption and emission,273 demonstrating longer
excited-state lifetimes than homo-gold nanoclusters.
Particularly, the 350 nm absorption was more pronounced in
Au@Ag nanoclusters, indicating the introduced Ag was on the
surface (doping Ag into the kernel would induce a significant
shift).273
Collectively, there are two alloying modes for Ag
heteroatoms to interact with the Au18(SR)14 template: doping
into the kernel, and alloying with the motifs, which would
induce effects on electronic/geometrical structures, and
variations in physical/chemical properties (such as PL) of the
parent Au18(SR)14 nanoclusters. The M18 system is interesting
because its HCP kernel is rarely observed in metal-thiolate
nanoclusters,90,117 and the unusual structure might bring
about very different physicochemical properties which is
deviated from other structures (icosahedral, FCC, etc.).274,275
2.3.2 Alloying based on FCC Au21(SR)15 nanocluster
There are two different structures for homo-gold Au21(SR)15,
represented by Au21(S-Adm)15 and Au21(S-tBu)15 (S-tBu = tertbutyl mercaptan). The Au21(S-Adm)15 is obtained by ligandexchanging Au18(S-C6H11)14 with HS-Adm, where the HCP Au9
kernel in Au18(SR)14 was transformed to an FCC Au10 kernel
which is protected by a bridging thiolate, an Au(SR)2
monomer, an Au2(SR)3 monomer, and an Au8(SR)9 staple
motif (Fig. 5a).270 By comparison, the Au21(S-tBu)15
counterpart comprises an Au14 kernel, capped by 5 bridging
thiolates, two Au2(SR)3 dimers, and an Au3(SR)4 staple motif
(Fig. 5b).276 Alloying has been successfully done on both Au21
nanoclusters. Of note, another Au21 was also reported, i.e.,
Au21S(S-Adm)15, but no alloying has been done yet.277,278
So far, only two heteroatoms (Ag, Cu) have been doped
into the Au21(SR)15 template by in-situ synthetic
procedures.277,279 Zhu and co-workers prepared a group of
HS-tBu stabilized Au21-xMx(SR)15 (Fig. 5b), including Au20Cu1(StBu) , Ag Au (S-tBu) , Au

21-xAgx(S- Bu)15 (x = 4-8), and Au21t
xCux(S- Bu)15 (x = 2-5). SC-XRD illustrated that the frameworks
of these nanoclusters are all alike to Au21(S-tBu)15 except the
Au21-xCux(S-tBu)15 (x = 2-5) which is alike to Au21(S-

Adm)15,270,276 demonstrating that more Cu dopants would
alter the structure of Au21(S-tBu)15. As to the slightly Agdoped Ag1Au20(S-tBu)15, the single Ag atom binds to Au2(SR)3
staple motif. As the Ag-doping number increases, more
parent Au atoms on the kernel shell can be substituted, and
finally, the staple Au can be replaced, too (Fig. 5b, upperright).276 The Cu doping is more complicated: (i) when the Cu
doping number is 1, the configuration of Au21(S-tBu)15 is
preserved, and Cu is arranged on the Au2(S-tBu)3 staple motif
(Fig. 5b, marked in dark blue); (ii) more Cu dopants would
alter the structure of Au21(S-tBu)15 to that of Au21(S-Adm)15.
Specifically, aside from the central Cu, two Au atoms on the
Au8(SR)9 motif are completely substituted as well, while other
Au positions on Au8(SR)9 are partially doped (Fig. 5b, marked
in dark green).276 Optical absorption spectra of these S-tBu
stabilized
nanoclusters
show
characteristic
peaks,
demonstrating that alloying remarkably affects the electronic
structure and chemical/physical properties of these
nanoclusters.276
Accessing a series of correlated bi-metallic nanoclusters
with different doping degrees and further revealing the
successive transformations are of critical importance for
gaining fundamental insight into the alloying mechanism. In
2018, Li et al. reported a series of correlated Au/Ag bimetallic
nanoclusters.279 Based on the structures of these alloy
nanoclusters and correlations between structures and optical
absorption, the effects of alloying on the evolution of size,
structure, and optical properties were analyzed.279
Structurally, the incomplete cuboctahedral FCC kernel of
Au21(S-Adm)15 first transforms to a complete cuboctahedral
Au12Ag1 kernel in the Au20Ag1(S-Adm)15, then to an
icosahedral Au10Ag3 kernel in Au19Ag4(S-Adm)15, Au23-xAgx(SAdm)15 (x ~5.76), and Au23-xAgx(S-Adm)15 (x ~7.44)
nanoclusters (Fig. 5c). Of note, the configuration of
Au20Ag1(S-Adm)15 is the same as that of Au20Ag1(S-tBu)15
nanocluster.276,279 Significantly, (i) along with the increase of
Ag number in the cluster, the cluster size increased from the
size of 21-metal (with a 11-metal kernel) to 23-metal (with a
13-metal kernel), and meanwhile, the free electron number
increased from 6e to 8e; (ii) such transformations could be
controlled by controlling the ratio of Au/Ag in the
precursor.279 Electron density accumulated on the center Au
atoms due to the large difference in electronegativity
between Au and Ag was rationalized to force an expansion of
radial metal-metal bond angles, which triggered the M21-toM23 configuration conversion (or cuboctahedral-toicosahedral kernel conversion).279 As for the S-Adm stabilized
Ag4Au19, AgxAu23-x (x ~5.76), and AgxAu23-x (x ~7.44) adopting
the same configurations, the optical gap increased (from 1.31
to 1.37 and 1.46 eV, respectively) along with the number of
Ag doping.279 This trend is consistent with the increased
HOMO-LUMO gap of doped AgxAu25-x(SR)18 nanoclusters
relative to that of homo-gold Au25(SR)18,65,177 which is caused
by the involvement of silver 5s and 5p orbitals in electronic
states.177

Fig. 5 Alloying based on the Au21(SR)15 template. (a) Structural anatomy of Au21(S-Adm)15 nanocluster. (b) Structural anatomy of
Au21(S-tBu)15 nanocluster and its Ag- or Cu-doping counterparts. (c) Evolution of crystal structures in synthesizing a series of
Au/Ag nanoclusters, depending on the Au/Ag ratio in precursors.
In summary, the Ag and Cu heterometals have been
incorporated into the Au21(SR)15 (SR = S-Adm or S-tBu)
templates. The alloying mode varies by the different
dopants (Ag versus Cu) and ligands (S-Adm versus S-tBu).
Series of correlated nanoclusters are achieved, making
them different from the simple templated doping mode
(with the structure preserved) we discussed in M25(SR)18
and M38(SR)24. This will pave the way towards controllable
synthesis of alloy nanoclusters with atomic-level
capabilities.
2.3.3 Alloying based on FCC Au23(SR)16 nanocluster
The FCC Au23(S-c-C6H13)16 contains a cuboctahedron (Au13)
kernel, which is capped by two hub-like gold atoms, and
further protected by four bridging thiolates, two Au1(SR)2
monomers, and two Au3(SR)4 trimers.280 Up to now, three
types of heteroatoms (M = Ag, Cd, Cu) have been doped
into the Au23 template. The alloying degree (or the doping
number) of each heteroatom can be controlled via
regulating the M/Au ratio in in-situ synthetic procedures, or
the amount of M-SR complexes reacting with the presynthesized Au23(SR)16. More than 10 derivatives have been
obtained on the basis of Au23(SR)16 (Fig. 6),179,194,200,281-283
including (i) Ag-doping derivatives: slightly-doped Au23xAgx(SR)16 (x ~0.87), moderately-doped Au25-xAgx(SR)18 (x
~4.49), heavily-doped Au25-xAgx(SR)18 (x ~19.4), Agdoped/ligand-exchanged Au24-xAgx(SR)20 (x ~1), and Ag-AuCl treated [Au21(SR)12(P-C-P)2][AgCl2] and [Au21(SR)12(P-C-

P)2][Cl]; (ii) Cd-doping derivatives: slightly-doped Au23xCdx(SR)16 (x ~2.3), Au/Cd alloy Au20Cd4(SH)(SR)19 and
Au19Cd2(SR)16, and Cd2+ or H2O2 oxidization-induced
transformation into Au28(SR)20; (iii) Cu-doping derivatives:
slightly-doped Au23-xCux(SR)16 (x ~1.66). Of note,
accompanied by the doping process, the cluster
constitution can be maintained or altered, depending on
the method, the quantity or the ligand of heteroatom
complexes.179,194,200,281-283
Altering the homo-gold precursor to Au/Ag = 1/0.07
produced slightly-doped Au23-xAgx(SR)16, in which the
Au23(SR)16 template was maintained.281 Structurally, four Au
sites, two on the kernel shell and the other two bridging the
Au13 kernel and motifs, can be substituted. The largest
occupancy of Ag at each position is only 31.5%. Based on
this alloy nanocluster, Li et al. demonstrated a site-specific
“surgery” on the surface motif via a two-step metalexchange process, causing the “resection” of two surface
Au atoms without altering the other parts of the initial
Au23(SR)16 nanocluster.281 Specifically, the Au23(SR)16 was
first alloyed into the slightly-doped Au23-xAgx(SR)16, and
then reacted with Au2Cl2(P-C-P) complex (P-C-P =
Ph2PCH2PPh2) to produce homo-gold [Au21(SR)12(P-C-P)2]+
(counterion: [AgCl2]-).281 In another work, [AgCl2]- was
substituted by Cl-,194 and these counterions indeed affect
the assembly of such nanoclusters and charge-transport
properties.194,281

Fig. 6 Alloying based on the Au23(SR)16 template. Crystal structures include Au23-xAgx(SR)16 (x ~0.87), Au25-xAgx(SR)18 (x ~4.49),
Au25-xAgx(SR)18 (x ~19.4), [Au21(SR)12(P-C-P)2][AgCl2], [Au21(SR)12(P-C-P)2][Cl], ligand-exchanged Au24-xAgx(SR)20 (x ~1), Au23xCux(SR)16 (x ~1.66), Au20Cd4(SH)(SR)19, Au28(SR)20, Au23-xCdx(SR)16 (x ~ 2.3), and Au19Cd2(SR)16. Of note, some in this figure are not
alloy nanoclusters (e.g., Au28(SR)20, Au21(SR)12(P-C-P)2), but they were synthesized in the presence of heteroatoms (e.g., Cd, Ag).
In contrast to the slightly-doped Au23-xAgx(SR)16 (x ~0.87),
increasing Ag-doping would transform M23 into Au25xAgx(SR)18 with moderate doping (x ~4.49), i.e. the size of the
nanocluster increased from M23 to M25.281 All Ag heteroatoms
were on the icosahedral kernel shell.281 More Ag doping
resulted in heavily-doped Au25-xAgx(SR)18 (x ~19.4), in which
only the center cannot be occupied by Ag heteroatom due to
the electronic effect. Collectively, a continuous Ag-doping
system is established: Au23(SR)16 → slightly-doped Au23xAgx(SR)16 (x ~0.87) → moderately-doped Au25-xAgx(SR)18 (x
~4.49) → heavily-doped Au25-xAgx(SR)18 (x ~19.4).179,280,281 A
noticeable conversion in cluster size/configuration occurs (i.e.,
from M23 to M25) when the doped Ag increases from ~1 to ~4.
This case is also used to support the M21 to M23
transformation we discussed in section 2.3.2 that partial
electron transfer would happen from Ag to Au to cause
electron density accumulation on the central Au to trigger the
structural transformation.279
Ligand-exchange on slightly-doped Au23-xAgx(SR)16 (x
~0.87) with HS-CH2Ph-tBu gives rise to Au24-xAgx(SR)20 (x
~1).282 Similar to the Ag23 → Au25-xAgx process, the sizegrowth process was observed in Au23-xAgx → Au24-xAgx, even if
the driving forces in these two reactions are different ―
doping effect versus ligand effect.179,282 The ligand exchange
induced Au23 → Au24 transformation was reported before.284
The obtained Au24-xAgx(SR)20 contains a M8 kernel that is
capped by four Au4(SR)5 tetramers, and only three special
kernel positions can be occupied by Ag atoms.282

Controlling the ratio of Au/Cd in the syntheses of Au/Cd
alloy nanoclusters enables control of the composition and
size. Li et al. successfully reconstructed the surface structure
of Au23(SR)16 by Cd alloying.283 A low Au/Cd ratio in the
precursor only introduced some Cd heteroatoms without
altering the Au23(SR)16 template, i.e., Au20.7Cd2.3(SR)16. At a
high Au/Cd ratio, Au19Cd2(SR)16 was obtained, representing a
size decrease (M23 → M21). Structurally, the cuboctahedral
Au13 kernel of Au19Cd2(SR)16 is the same as that of Au23(SR)16.
However, the two adjacent gold atoms on the motif in
Au23(SR)16 coalesced and were occupied by one introduced
Cd heteroatom, creating a “paw-like” Cd(SR)3 motif.283 In all,
the surface reconstruction induced by Cd doping is as follows,
Au23(SR)16 → slightly-doped Au23-xCdx(SR)16 (x ~2.3) →
Au19Cd2(SR)16.
Au23-xCdx(SR)16 and Au19Cd2(SR)16 nanoclusters were
obtained via an in-situ synthetic procedure. Interestingly,
some unexpected phenomena occurred by reacting
Au23(SR)16 with Cd(SR)2 complex or Cd(NO3)2 ions (AGR
reaction).200 Adding Cd(SR)2 to Au23(SR)16 solution
transformed Au23 to Au20Cd4(SH)(SR)19, and the introduced Cd
heteroatoms were at specific positions in both staple motifs
and kernel.200 In comparison, the addition of Cd(NO3)2 ions
would
transform
Au23(SR)16
into
a
larger
nanocluster―Au28(SR)20―by oxidation.200 It should be noted
that Higaki et al. earlier reported the transformation from
Au23(SR)16 to Au28(SR)20 by H2O2 oxidation.285 Tang et al.
found that this growth could also be promoted by photons

with energy higher than the HOMO-LUMO energy gap of
Au23(SR)16.286 It is worth noting that light was also found to
promote the one-electron oxidation of Au25(SR)18- to
Au25(SR)180.287 The photoinduction pathway could be
exploited in future work.
Aside from Ag and Cd, Cu alloying based on the Au23(SR)16
template has also been achieved by the metal-exchange
strategy.283 Very few Cu heteroatoms could be exclusively
introduced into the staple motifs of Au23 with the
composition as Au21.34Cu1.66(SR)16. Increasing the quantity of
Cu dopants would cause the decomposition of the
template.283
Overall, Au23(SR)16 has emerged as one of the most
versatile templates to “absorb”, “eliminate” and
“accommodate” atoms upon alloying with heteroatoms such
as Ag, Cd, and Cu. The number of heteroatoms in these Au23based alloy nanoclusters is controlled by (i) different M/Au
ratios in the in-situ synthetic procedures, (ii) different heterometal complex/Au23 ratio. The structure of Au23 maintains in
the case of slight-doping; however, overdosing heteroatoms
transforms Au23 into other sizes/shapes. From this viewpoint,
the transformation point (or the extreme that maintains the
Au23 configuration) is of great significance for thoroughly
grasping the alloying mechanism in FCC structures.

network model is proposed, in which multiple 4-center-2
electron tetrahedral Au4 units can be found.306,307
Experimental work also identified Au4 features.296 Thus, it
might be very hard to break such electronic structures, hence,
doping such FCC nanoclusters has met with difficulties;
otherwise, structural transformation would be inevitable.

2.3.4 Alloying in FCC Au36(SR)24 nanocluster template
Au36(SR)24 contains an FCC Au28(SR)12 kernel, which is capped
by four Au2(SR)3 staple motifs (Fig. 7a).288-290 Since structural
determination in 2012, many works have been reported on

investigations,
and alloying. Besides, two other types of
Au36 nanoclusters, i.e., Au36(SR)8Cl20 (with a different
structure) and Au36(PhC≡C)24) were also reported.300,301
The Ag and Cu have been introduced into the Au36(SR)24
(SR = S-Ph-tBu) template.302-305 By altering the Au:Ag ratios in
the precursor, Dass and co-workers found that up to 8 Ag
heteroatoms could be incorporated into Au36(SR)24.302 In 2019,
Sakthivel et al. reported the X-ray crystal structure of Au36t
303
SC-XRD revealed a composition of
xAgx(S-Ph- Bu)24.
Au33.17Ag2.83(S-Ph-tBu)24 with 2 Ag heteroatoms doped on the
28-atom FCC kernel and 0.83 Ag distributed over metal atoms
on the staple motifs (Fig. 7b).303
Au36-xCux(SR)24 nanoclusters were prepared and
structurally determined.305 Compared with Ag-doping in the
Au36-xAgx(SR)24 (x = 1-8), the number of doped Cu (x up to 3) is
even smaller. Besides, Cu was also observed inside the FCC
Au28 kernel of the Au36(SR)24 template (Fig. 7c), and a total of
14 sites could be substituted.305
Ag- and Cu-doping have been accomplished in the
Au36(SR)24 template. Both Ag and Cu heteroatoms can be
doped in staple motifs, and can also substitute the surface
atoms in the FCC part of Au36(SR)24. General speaking, doping
in FCC Au nanoclusters (Au23, Au36, etc.) is quite challenging.
This can be understood by their unique electronic structure
being very different from the superatom ones such as
M25(SR)18, M44(SR)30, etc. For FCC nanoclusters, a superatom

2.4 Alloying in small-sized Au:PPh3 nanocluster template
Early research on phosphine-protected gold nanoclusters
includes Au9, Au11, Au13, and other sizes.47,93,103,308 Typically,
these small-sized nanoclusters adopt an incomplete or full
icosahedral configuration. Here, we briefly summarize alloys
based on Au9, Au11, and Au13 nanoclusters.
Au9(PPh3)8 is one of the earliest studied small-sized gold
nanoclusters.309-313 Crystal structures of Au9 demonstrate the
reversible isomerization of this cluster. Specifically,
[Au9(PPh3)8]3+ with a crown-like structure is crystallized in the
presence of [PMo12O40]3− counter-ions; while a butterfly-like
configuration can be observed when the Au9 nanocluster is
evaporated in the presence of Cl- or NO3- counter-ions.312,313
The presence of a Pd source in the synthesis results in
[Pd1Au8(PPh3)8]2+.314-316 The central Au atom in the crown-like
Au9 is substituted; however, whether the Pd1Au8 is butterflylike or not is not known yet (Fig. 8a). The Tsukuda group gave
some reasons: First, DFT calculations demonstrated that the
energy differences between the crown- and butterfly-like Au9
nanoclusters were comparable to those between crown- and
butterfly-like Pd1Au8 counterparts, i.e., the relative stability
was not the reason. Second, the temperature-dependent
Debye-Waller factors illustrated that the bond strength in

crown-like Pd1Au8 was much stiffer than that in crown-like
Au9. Third, the natural bond orbital analysis revealed that the
stiffer Pd-Au and Au-Au bonds in crown-like Pd1Au8 relative to
the corresponding Au-Au bonds in crown-like Au9 originated
from the increase in the ionic nature (Pd--Au+) and the
decrease in electrostatic repulsion between the surface Au
atoms in Pd1Au8 nanocluster, respectively.316
Besides the enhanced metal-metal bonds in Pd1Au8
relative to those in Au9, the Pd-Au synergetic effects will also
regulate the electronic/geometrical structures and
chemical/physical properties. Pd doping into Au9 alters its
structure, especially the ligand arrangement;317 thus, the
collision cross section (CCS, evaluated using the ion mobility
mass spectrometry) values of these two nanoclusters are
different: the CCS value of Pd1Au8(PPh3)8 is 422 Å2, much
smaller than that of the Au9(PPh3)8 (442 Å2).317
In 2018, Takano et al. doped a hydride (H-) into the Au9 or
Pd1Au8 cluster surface, and then reacted the H-Au9 or HPd1Au8 cluster with Au(I)-Cl (Fig. 8b).318,319 The (H-Au9)2+ was
converted to superatomic Au113+ in the presence of Au(I)-Cl,
via the Au102+ superatom.318 A sharp difference in the same
procedure was observed when the interstitially doped Hsurvived during the sequential addition of Au(I)-Cl, and the
(H-Pd1Au10)3+ was the only product.320 These opposite Auaddition results between (H-Au9)2+ and (H-Pd1Au8)+
nanoclusters further demonstrate that the doping effect
induced by the Pd would significantly affect their behaviors in
the bottom-up synthetic procedure (i.e., Au-addition process).
Similar to the Pd doping process, a single Pt atom was
doped into the center of the Au9 cluster.320,321 Two situations
can be observed from Pt/Pd doping: (i) only a single Pt/Pd
heteroatom can be doped; (ii) the doped Pt/Pd heteroatom
occupies the center in Au9. Of note, this is exactly the same as
what is observed in other mono-Pd/Pt-doped homo-gold or
homo-silver nanoclusters (e.g., Pt1Au24(SR)18, Pd1Au24(SR)18
see Section 2.1, and Pt1Ag24(SR)18, and Pd1Ag24(SR)18 see
Section 3.1). Such characteristics might originate from the
differences in electronic structures (outermost electronic
configuration) between Au/Ag and Pd/Pt atoms.
Au11 and Au13 are the other two small-sized, phosphineprotected nanoclusters that have been successfully
alloyed.322-331 Based on these two templates, alloy
nanoclusters of Pd/Au, Pt/Au, Ag/Au, and Cu/Au have been
prepared.332-338 By simultaneously reducing Au(PPh3)Cl and
Pd(PPh3)4 complexes, Kurashige and Negishi reported
Pd1Au10(PPh3)8Cl2 (Fig. 8c).332 The stability of Pd1Au10 was
much higher than Au11, but no structure of Pd1Au10 was
obtained. The Pd1Au10 emitted at ~950 nm with a PL QY of
0.15% owing to the synergetic effect between Au and Pd,
while Au11 was non-emissive.332 Steggerda and co-workers

reported the hydride-containing H-Pt/Ag/Au and H-Pt/Cu/Au
tri-metallic nanoclusters, with chemical formulas of [HPt1(X)1(AuPPh3)8]- and [H-Pt1(X)2(AuPPh3)8]- (X = AgNO3 or
CuCl), corresponding to the Au10 and Au11, respectively.333,334
Structurally, the single Pt atom occupies the center position,
and the Au, Ag, and Cu atoms are on the surface.333,334
Different from the aforementioned phosphine-protected
alloy nanoclusters that were prepared by the in-situ synthetic
procedure, Copley and Mingos developed a metal-exchange
method to synthesize small-sized alloy nanoclusters.335,336
Specifically, the reaction between Au11(PPh3)10 and Au(I) (or
Ag(I),
Cu(I))
complexes
generate
Au13(PPh3)8Cl4,
Ag4Au9(PPh3)8Cl4, or Cu4Au9(PPh3)8Cl4 (Fig. 8d).336 For these
M13 nanoclusters, Au atoms (or the introduced Ag/Cu
heteroatoms) on the surface could be divided into two
categories: (i) the 8 surface Au atoms (from the starting Au11)
binding to PPh3 that were originally on Au11; (ii) the four M
atoms (M = Au/Ag/Cu) connecting to Cl ligands that are
concomitantly introduced to the Au13 system.336
Qin et al. obtained the crystal structure of
Ag3Au8(PPh3)7Cl3.337 The Ag3Au8 nanocluster possesses a
similar structure as that of Au11, both having an 8e closed
shell electronic structure. Three Ag heteroatoms are found to
be on the surface and are bonded with the three chlorine
ligands.337
In 2017, Lv et al. theoretically investigated the alloying
effects based on the structure of Au13(PPh3)8Cl4
nanoclusters.338 DFT results illustrated that the Ag and Cu
heteroatoms prefer the surface sites, whereas the single Pd
tends to occupy the central position. By doping different
types of heteroatoms, the geometric structure and the
frontier orbitals of Au13 change in different ways. The Pd
doping leads to relatively longer metal-metal distances within
the icosahedron, while the bond lengths are significantly
shortened when Cu heteroatoms are incorporated. In
addition, theoretical energies between the highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) follow the order of Pd1Au12 <
Ag4Au9 < Au13 ≈ Cu4Au9.338
Based on these phosphine-protected alloy nanoclusters,
one can conclude that the Ag/Cu alloying is (i) in multiple
number and (ii) surface-doping. By comparison, the Pd and Pt
follow a mono-doping and central occupation tendency. The
reason might be the difference in outermost electron
configurations between Au/Ag/Cu and Pt/Pd atoms, i.e.
Au/Ag/Cu (d10s1) vs. Pd (d10s0) vs. Pt (d10) in the doped state.
Other alloying works based on small-sized phosphineprotected Au clusters can be found in Ref. 93.

2.5 Alloying in cluster of clusters
Before the attainment of rod-like Au25 co-protected by
phosphine and halogen ligands, Teo and coworkers reported
rod-like Au25-xMx nanoclusters (M = Ag, Pt, Pd) in the 1980s,
and they proposed a “cluster of clusters” assembly pattern
that generalized the structural- and size-growth mode based
on these alloy nanoclusters.339-345 The follow-up works
include the experimental formation of a relatively large
(Au13)55
assembled
super-cluster
and
theoretical
investigations on the assembled linear or cyclic (M13)n
nanoclusters.346-348 The synthesis and crystal structure of rodlike [Au25(SR)5(PPh3)10Cl2]2+ (Fig. 9a) were reported by
Tsukuda’s group in 2007.349 For the M25 rod cluster, because
the halogen-Ag bond is much stronger than halogen-Au (e.g.,
Ag-Cl bond energy of 314 ± 21 KJ/mol > Au-Cl bond energy of
289 ± 63 KJ/mol; and so are the M-Br and M-I bonds),350 the
metal atoms that coordinate to the halogen atoms are all Ag
atoms. By comparison, Au atoms preferentially take the top
and bottom pentagonal positions that bond to the PPh3
ligands. Similar bonding modes have been observed in
halogen/phosphine co-protected M37 and M38 alloy
nanoclusters (vide infra). Introducing thiol into the Au11

solution successfully assembled the icosahedral building
blocks into an Au25 nanocluster.349 Structurally, two
icosahedral Au13 building blocks are fused together by sharing
a vertical gold atom and are also linked by five thiolates (Fig.
9a). On a note, the halogen-protected rod-like Au25
counterpart (i.e., halogen replacing thiolate) has not been
experimentally available (see the [Au25(PPh3)10Cl7]2+, Fig. 9a),
probably due to the less stable Au-halogen bonds. The
alloying nanoclusters for cluster of clusters are summarized in
Table 3. Several other works were reported for the rod-like
[Au25(SR)5(PPh3)10X2]2+ (X = Cl/Br) nanoclusters,351-355 and the
chemical/physical properties were investigated, including the
ultrafast dynamics, optical and electrochemical properties.356359

Based on the “cluster of clusters” assembly mode, Teo
and co-workers reported a series of structures of Au12Ag13
nanoclusters co-protected by phosphine and halogen ligands
(Fig. 9b).360-365 Specifically, Ag atoms are at the top/bottom
apexes, the waist, and the shared vertex. By comparison, Au
atoms prefer to occupy the sites that are capped by
phosphine ligands, and the centers of the two icosahedra.
Interestingly, two types of waist-halogen protecting modes
are observed, labeled as X5 and X6 (Fig. 9b). As for the X5

mode, the formula is [Au12Ag13(PPh3)X7]2+, in which the waistAg atoms are linked by five halogen atoms, with “one-to-one”
linking (Fig. 9b, upper-right).363 When six halogen atoms are
introduced to give rise to [Au12Ag13(PPh3)X8]+, the capping
mode at the waist positions is shown in Fig. 9b, bottomright.361,362,364,365 Using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as
size-selection templates, Zhu and co-workers obtained pure
[Au12Ag13(PPh3)10Cl8]+ nanocluster via a one-step, in-situ
reduction method.366 Nunokawa et al. replaced the halogen
ligands with NO3- and synthesized a charge-neutral
Au12Ag7(PPhMe2)10(NO3)9 (Fig. 9d), whose configuration is a
bi-capped pentagonal anti-prismatic cage with staggeredstaggered M5 rings (M = Au/Ag).367 The Au12Ag7 nanocluster
exhibits an interpenetrated biicosahedron mode and
provides the missing link between icosahedral M13 and biicosahedral M25 nanoclusters, and hence useful insights into
the nanocluster growth.367

Inspired by the reaction of small-sized phosphineprotected gold nanoclusters with thiols to generate the
homo-gold [Au25(SR)5(PPh3)10Cl2]2+ nanocluster,350 Wang et al.
introduced Ag-SR complexes into this size-growth process,
and was able to adjust the number of Ag heteroatoms doped
into the rod-like M25 template (Fig. 9c).368 Two approaches
were developed: (i) doping the PPh3-capped gold
nanoclusters with Ag-SR complexes to generate [Au252+ nanoclusters with x ≤ 12; (ii) metalxAgx(SR)5(PPh3)10Cl2]
exchanging the [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]+ with Ag-SR complexes to
generate [Au25-xAgx(SR)5(PPh3)10Cl2]2+ nanoclusters with x ≤ 13.
SC-XRD results demonstrated that the shared vertex, the
waist, and the icosahedral centers were randomly occupied
by Au or Ag, but with a much higher Ag percentage for the x ≤
13 nanocluster.368 Significantly, in sharp contrast to the nonemissive [Au25(SR)5(PPh3)10Cl2]2+, and the weakly-emissive
[Au25-xAgx(SR)5(PPh3)10Cl2]2+
(x
≤
12),
the
[Au252+ (x ≤ 13) showed a 200-fold QY boost in
xAgx(SR)5(PPh3)10Cl2]
PL, illustrating the important role of the 13th silver in the
nanocluster.368 Further theoretical work suggested that the
origin of PL boost lied in the nature of the first excited state
(S1) and its corresponding HOMO-LUMO transition, which
was significantly affected by the doping number and position
of Ag heteroatoms in the rod-like Au25 template.369 Ultrafast

relaxation dynamics of these M25 nanoclusters were also
investigated for understanding the mechanism of the PL
enhancement,370 which will be presented in Section 7.
Mattoussi and co-worker reported the synthesis of
functionalized Au/Ag alloy nanocluster by reacting the
Au11(PPh3)8Cl2 with Ag(I)-SR complexes, where SR is shortchain aliphatic monothiols, poly(ethylene glycol)- or
zwitterion-appended monothiols.371 The optical absorption
and PL emission of the obtained Au/Ag nanoclusters were
very close to those of [Au25-xAgx(SC2H4Ph)5(PPh3)10Cl2]2+.371
Because of the similarity in electronic structures of Ag and
Cu with Au (d10s1 configuration), the single-heteroatom
doping into gold nanoclusters is limited, that is, easily forming
a distribution of Cu or Ag dopants in Aun templates (see
section 2.3.1-2.3.4). Wang et al. put forward an alloying
strategy to shuttle a single Ag or Cu heteroatom into a
centrally
hollow,
rod-shaped
[Au24(SR)5(PPh3)10Cl2]2+
nanocluster, transforming it into Ag1Au24 and Cu1Au24 alloy
nanoclusters in a highly controllable manner (Fig. 9e/f).372
The hollow Au24 rod (c.f. the center-filled Au25 rod) was
prepared by etching the [Au25(SR)5(PPh3)10Cl2]2+ rod with a
large amount of PPh3,373 with theoretical insight reported by
Goh et al.374 Furthermore, reacting this hollow Au24 with AuCl,
AgCl or CuCl salt produced “non-hollow” Au25, Ag1Au24, and
Cu1Au24 rod, respectively.372 The introduced Ag heteroatom
occupies one apex site. Repeating the PPh3 etching and Ag
doping process generated Ag2Au23, in which both apex sites
became Ag (Fig. 9e).
Compared to Ag doping, alloying the hollow Au24 with
CuCl was different. The mono-Cu heteroatom was selectively
doped into two different sites in the template with 30% of
apex-doping and 70% of waist-doping (Fig. 9f), that is, a
distribution of two configurations. This ligand-induced singleheteroatom shuttling procedure provides a strategy to
control the doping number and the site of heteroatoms in
M25 rods.372 For comparison, multi-Cu doped [Au252+ (x ~2.75) was later obtained,375 in
xCux(SR)5(PPh3)10Cl2]
which the Au25-xCux rods were prepared by doping PPh3stabilized gold nanoparticles with Cu(I)-SR complexes. SC-XRD
revealed that both the apex and the waist sites are partially
occupied with Cu/Au = 1:3 proportion (Fig. 9g).375
An interesting phenomenon in the aforementioned M25
rod nanoclusters is that the centers of icosahedrons are
always occupied by Au atoms in Ag or Cu doping, which
indicates the gold atoms at icosahedral centers are critical to
ensure the stability. However, Pd or Pt doping would take the
central site of the icosahedron, i.e. a Pt/Pd@Au/Ag mode (Fig.
9h). Negishi and co-workers reacted Aun-xPdx (n = 6-12; x = 02) with abundant thiol to assemble these small-sized
nanoclusters into a bi-icosahedral [Pd1Au24(SR)5(PPh3)10Cl2]+
nanocluster in which one of the two icosahedral centers was
substituted by Pd.376 In another work, substitution of both
central Au atoms by Pd was accomplished.377 Considering
that alloying is capable of tailoring the electronic structure of
nanoclusters, Kang et al. introduced the Pd heteroatom into
the M25 template and successfully obtained the
electroneutral Pd2Au23(PPh3)10Br7 possessing unprecedented

Au-halogen linkages.377 SC-XRD results suggested that the
two centers of M13 building blocks were occupied by Pd
atoms. By comparison, the absence of Pd sources resulted in
un-assembled Au11 nanoclusters. Hirshfeld charge analyses
implied that significantly reduced electronic repulsion
between two icosahedral units induced by the synergism
between Pd and Au metals promoted the assembly.377 Such
results expand the scope of linkage in rod-like M25

nanoclusters.377 With Pt or Pd heteroatoms in the center(s) of
the icosahedron(s), several other M25 nanoclusters with trimetallic compositions were also obtained and structurally
determined, including Pt1Ag12Au12, Pt2Ag13Au10 nanoclusters
(Fig. 9h),378-381 which will be discussed in section 5. Besides,
based on the rod-like M25 template, the alloying effects on
geometric structures, electronic structures, optical properties
(such as PL and ECL) have been investigated.382-385

Nanoclusters with a cyclic M37 framework were also
reported in early work by Teo and co-workers. The structure
of Au18Ag19(PPh3)12Br11 comprises three M13 (M = Au/Ag)
icosahedral building blocks formed a cyclic assembly via
vertex-sharing.386
The
Cu-doped
M37,
i.e.
Cu3Au34(PPh3)13(SR)6S2, was also determined structurally,375
which can be described as three icosahedral M13 building
blocks sharing three vertex Au atoms in a cyclic fashion (Fig.
9i). The three Cu atoms occupy the internal positions of the
cluster core, and interestingly, all Cu atoms are monocoordinated to the bare S atoms.375 Compared with Agalloying based on the M37 template, Cu-alloying follows a
slight doping manner. It should be noted that linear
Au37(SR)10(PPh3)10X2 (X = Cl/Br) was also structurally
determined,387 and the related calculations as well as
applications were performed;388,389 however, no alloying
work based on this linear nanocluster was reported. The
penta-icosahedral Au60 is a cyclic assembly of five Au13
icosahedral via sharing five vertex Au atoms.390
Within the “cluster of clusters” frame, M38 nanoclusters
were structurally determined via cyclic assembly of three
icosahedral M13 building blocks via vertex sharing.391-394 The
metal compositions of these M38 are Au18Ag20; however, two
categories of the peripheral ligands were observed: 12
phosphines and 14 halogen ligands (i.e., Au18Ag20(PPh3)12Cl14),
or 14 phosphines and 12 halogen ligands (i.e.,
Au18Ag20(PPh3)14Cl12). Fig. 9j exhibits the crystal structure of
Au18Ag20(PPh3)12Cl14.392
The
metal
framework
of
Au18Ag20(PPh3)12Cl14 contains a triangular tri-icosahedral core
plus two capping Ag atoms on the pseudo-3-foId axis. Of note,
the centers of three icosahedrons in M38 nanoclusters are
100% occupied by Au atoms.391-394
Taken together, under the concept of “cluster of clusters”,
the mono-icosahedral M13 unit has been alloyed, and larger
nanoclusters were also obtained via fusion growth, with bi-,
tri-, and multi-icosahedral structures. Three types of ligands
are commonly used for stabilizing the nanocluster: halogens,
phosphines, and thiols. Structurally, the rod-like (AuAg)25
nanocluster shows that Au atoms preferentially occupy the
top/bottom pentagonal sites that bind to the phosphine
ligands, whereas the Ag atoms are generally arranged at the
apex, the waist positions that link to the halogen or thiolate
ligands, and the shared vertex. Such arrangements are
proposed to be a result of the stronger bonding of Au-P than
Ag-P, so is Ag-Cl (or Ag-Br) vs. Au-Cl (or Au-Br). The center of
each icosahedral building block can be replaced by Pt/Pd. Of
note, the central Pt/Pd doping is similar as alloy nanoclusters
based on Au25(SR)18, Ag25(SR)18, and Au38(SR)24 templates that
possess icosahedral M13 units. Assembling more icosahedral
M13 building blocks would generate M36, M37, and M38 alloy
nanocluster with different assembly patterns (linear or cyclic
assembly), or vertex-sharing modes. However, alloying works
based on larger-sized templates (e.g. cyclic Au60) are still
absent, which requires future efforts. The different size may
induce different doping modes and alloy structures.

2.6 Alloying in Au144(SR)60 nanocluster template
Au144(SR)60 is one of the most important nanoclusters that
have long been attractive to researchers. Although its
molecular formula was determined by mass spectroscopy a
decade ago, the crystal structure remained mysterious for
another decade.395-400 Determination of the precise structure
of Au144 is of great significance to evaluate the alloying modes
as well as the alloying effects. Several approaches including
DFT calculations and TEM (transmission electron microscopy)
were performed to predict the structure of the Au144(SR)60.401403 In 2018, Wu and co-workers unraveled the X-ray structure
of this long-pursued nanocluster.404 It was found to exhibit a
tetra-stratified arrangement: Au12(kernel, M-L1) @Au42(1stshell, M-L2) @Au60(2nd-shell, M-L3) @Au30(SR)60(surface, ML4). The average Au-Au bond length in M-L3 is about 2.884 Å,
which is close to that of bulk Au, indicating that this
nanocluster exhibits some metal character; however, other
Au-Au bonds are much shorter, demonstrating the non-metal
character of this nanocluster. In this context, the Au144(SR)60
nanocluster is in a transition state between nanoclusters and
nanoparticles in view of chemical bonding.404 Of note, at the
same time, the Wang group reported the structure of Au144
stabilized by C≡C-PhF.405 The two Au144 nanoclusters display a
similar core structure but different arrangements of surface
ligands.
Prior to the Au144 structure determination, three types of
hetero-metals have been introduced into the Au144(SR)60
template, including Ag, Cu, and Pd. Kumara and Dass
obtained a series of Au144-xAgx(SR)60 nanoclusters by reducing
Au/Ag-SR precursors (SR = S-C2H4Ph, S-C6H13, S-C12H25).406 The
value of x in Au144-xAgx(SR)60 could be controlled by regulating
the Ag/Au ratios. In general, the larger the Ag/Au ratio, the
heavier the Ag doping in the Au144-xAgx template. ESI-MS and
MALDI-MS results revealed that up to 60 Ag heteroatoms
could be introduced to the template.406 Considering that the
maximum Ag-doping number was equal to the Au number in
the 2nd-shell (M-L3) of Au144(SR)60, it was proposed that
doped Ag preferentially substituted the Au atoms in the 2ndshell.406 Of note, such a kernel-surface alloying mode of Ag
(i.e., Ag are doped to the outermost surface of the kernel) is
the same as that in Au25(SR)18 (section 2.1). Based on the
Au144-xAgx(SR)60 with different x values, the Ag-doping effects
on optical absorption were experimentally and theoretically
studied.406-409 Collectively, although the crystal structure of
Au144-xAgx(SR)60 is not accessible yet, all of the experimental
and theoretical results suggest the kernel’s surface doping
mode.406-410 The Ag-alloying has also been accomplished in
Au130(SR)50 and Au329(SR)84 nanoclusters, but the structures of
the alloying products remain un-determined.411,412
In addition to Ag-doping, Cu and Pd are incorporated into
the Au144(SR)60 template as well.413-415 ESI-MS results revealed
that up to 23 Au atoms could be substituted by Cu.
Considering that (i) the occupation of Cu in the inner kernel
could avoid lattice mismatch due to the difference between
Au and Cu in terms of atomic radii, and (ii) Cu has a higher

surface energy than Au, Dass and co-workers proposed that
the Cu heteroatoms were preferentially dispersed into the ML1 and M-L2 shells, which was also supported by the
maximum doping number of ~23.413 Molola et al.
theoretically investigated the Cu doping positions in the
M144(SR)60 template and reached the same conclusion.414
The Dass group also introduced Pd heteroatoms into
Au144(SR)60,415 in which up to seven Pd could be doped.
Compared with the Ag- and Cu-alloying, the Pd-doping
degree is much slighter. Of note, except the Pd2Au36(SR)24
and Pd2Au23(PPh3)10X7 nanoclusters (sections 2.2 and 2.5)
that contain two icosahedral units, PdxAu144-x(SR)60 is the only
nanocluster that can be doped with multiple Pd.415
In all, Ag, Cu, and Pd heteroatoms can be introduced into
the Au144(SR)60 template with different alloying modes: (i) up
to 60 Ag heteroatoms could be doped; (ii) 1-23 Cu can be
detected in Au144-xCux(SR)60; (iii) only slight-doping for Pd is
achieved (up to 7). Of note, although some rational
predictions have been made on the alloying modes of Au144xMx(SR)60 (M = Ag/Cu/Pd), their crystal structures are not
available yet. Thus, many questions still remain. Besides,
alloying Au144(SR)60 with Pt, Cd, Hg has not been reported.
Finally, Au144-xAgx(SR)60 with narrow range x values might be
achievable and would facilitate clear correlation between the
Ag-doping extent and effects on the properties.
Studying the alloying phenomena in the nanoclusters is of
great significance, which will provide important information
for alloying in regular metal nanoparticles (e.g., 5-100 nm).
The latter particles display metallic character, and galvanic
reduction is widely used for alloying. For instance, Au ions are
used to etch Ag nanoparticles (e.g., Au+ + Ag0 → Ag+ + Au0),
but the reversible process cannot be implemented because
Ag is more active than Au.196-198 However, when the size is
reduced, ultrasmall nanoparticles (e.g., nanoclusters) will
show non-metal character, thus anti-galvanic reaction seems
to occur. For example, Ag+ can replace some Au0 atoms in Au
nanoclusters (e.g., x Ag+ + Au25(SR)18 → x Au+ + AgxAu25174 Such non-metal character is proposed to result
x(SR)18).
from the ultra-small sizes of these nanoclusters.
Many cases of large-sized gold- and silver-thiolate
nanoclusters with precise compositions, such as Au146, Au246,
Au279, Au333,53,416-426 and Ag146, Ag152, Ag206, Ag374,54,427-431
have been reported. Higaki et al. discovered a sharp
transition from nonmetallic Au246 to metallic Au279 with
nascent plasmon.53,417,419 But the case of Ag nanoclusters
remains elusive. The multiple bands in the optical spectrum
of the Ag146 nanocluster indicates a molecular state, while
that of Ag~230 seems plasmonic,427 i.e., the transition seems to
move to smaller sizes than the gold system. Thus, one may
expect that Ag alloying would alter the boundary between
nonmetallic and metallic state, which is worth studying
further.

3 Alloying in homo-silver nanocluster templates

This section summarizes the alloying based on homo-silver
templates, including the icosahedral Ag25, the icosaheral Ag29,
the hollow icosahedral Ag44, and Ag20/21 stabilized by S/Se
donor ligands.
3.1 Alloying in icosahedral Ag25(SR)18 template
The [Ag25(SR)18]- (SR = S-PhMe2) was synthesized and
structurally determined in 2015,432 and this nanocluster could
be prepared by either directly reducing Ag-SR complexes, or
etching Ag44(SR)30 (section 3.4) or Ag59(SR)32 with HSPhMe2.433,434 Importantly, Ag25(SR)18 is analogous to and
corresponds well with the Au25(SR)18 in terms of formula and
structure (Fig. 10). Accordingly, Ag25(SR)18, together with its
gold analogue, offers the first model to investigate the
fundamental differences between Au and Ag in chemical and
physical properties, as well as alloying behavior.432 The
average M-M and M-S bond lengths in Ag25 are shorter than
those in Au25. Some silver atoms on staple motifs show a μ3Ag bonding mode, i.e., each Ag atom links three adjacent
sulfur atoms on thiolate ligands. By comparison, each staple
gold atom in Au25(SR)18 displays a μ2-Au bonding mode (i.e.,
linking with two S atoms exclusively).
Alloying based on the Ag25(SR)18 template is summarized
in Table 4. The Pt or Pd heteroatom can be doped into the
Ag25(SR)18 nanocluster.435 following the single- and centraldoping mode (Fig. 10), similar to the case of Pd/Pt doping
into the Au25(SR)18 template.210,216 However, the M1Ag24(SR)18
(M = Pt/Pd) displays a “-2” charge state, which is in contrast
with the charge-neutral M1Au24(SR)18.63,64 Although
[Pt2Ag23(SR)18]2- was detected by ESI-MS spectrometry, the
position of the second Pt heteroatom in the template is
unclear yet, and Pt2Ag23(SR)18 also exhibited a low stability
and would decompose during the crystallization process.

Both Au25 and Ag25 fit the superatoms model. The
M@Au24 can have both “0” and “-2” charge states
corresponding to 6e and 8e, respectively.211,222 However, only
“-2” charge state is observed in M@Ag24, indicating that the
closed electron shell must be fulfilled in the Ag25 system. The
Jahn-Teller effect is used to explain the drastically changed
HOMO-LUMO gaps observed in 6e M@Au24, resulting in the
splitting of the originally triply degenerated 1P orbitals.211 We
suppose that Pt/Pd doping into Ag25 would not interrupt the
degeneration of its 1P orbitals, making it hard to remove
electron(s) from the closed shell. The difference between

Au25(SR)18- and Ag25(SR)18- could be due to the much stronger
spin-orbit coupling in gold.
A galvanic metal-exchange strategy has been devised to
synthesize mono-Au doped Au1Ag24(SR)18 nanocluster (Fig.
10).69 Specifically, reacting Ag25(SR)18 with Au(PPh3)Cl leads to
one Au in the center of the icosahedral kernel. By comparison,
in-situ co-reducing the Ag/Au precursors produced a mixture
of Ag25-xAux(SR)18, where x = 1-8.69 The non-centered Au were
proposed to be onto the icosahedral kernel shell, and these
M25 with more than one Au atoms would decompose in recrystallization processes, leaving mono-doped Au1Ag24(SR)18.
Bakr and co-workers proposed the single Au doping
mechanism ― the introduced Au+ ion was first reduced to
Au0 by the Ag0 (Ag+ was formed at the same time) and then
Au0 substituted one of the M13 kernel-surface silver atoms.
The Au heteroatom at the surface site might not be
thermodynamically favorable, thus, it diffused into the center
of M13, and pushed the central Ag atom to the icosahedral
surface concomitantly.69
Based on water-soluble Ag25(MHA)18 (MHA = 6mercaptohexanoic acid), Zheng et al. reported the real-time
monitoring of the dynamic Au-heteroatom diffusion into the
Ag25(MHA)18 by in situ UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, ESIMS, and MS/MS techniques.436 Specifically, to the aqueous
phase of Ag25, an equimolar of Au-MHA complex was added,

producing the mono-Au doped nanocluster; that is, this
alloying process is a stoichiometric reaction. Because the
hydrophilic Ag25(MHA)18 could be directly ionized, it is
possible to do real-time monitoring of the alloying process.436
Besides, real-time MS/MS was performed to monitor the
fragmentation patterns of Au1Ag24(MHA)18 during the alloying
process. The combination of real-time experiments and DFT
calculations demonstrated that the mono Au-alloying process
underwent three steps: (i) substituting one Ag atom in the
Ag2(MHA)3 motif by an Au heteroatom; (ii) diffusion of the Au
heteroatom into the Ag12 kernel shell; (iii) diffusion of the Au
heteroatom to the center of the icosahedral kernel.436
The
combination
of
Ag25(SR)18,
Pt1Ag24(SR)18,
Pd1Ag24(SR)18, and Au1Ag24(SR)18 nanoclusters (with the same
structure but different central atom) is consistent with the
common behavior that atoms with higher electronegativity
(Au = 2.54, Pt = 2.28, Pd = 2.20 vs. Ag = 1.93) tend to take the
inner position(s), which concentrates the electron density in
the center and stabilize the structure. Besides, based on the
M1Ag24(SR)18, chemical/physical properties have been
thoroughly investigated, including thermal-stability,69 optical
absorption
and
emission,69,437-439
catalysis,440
and

electrochemical properties,
which will be discussed in

In summary, Au, Pt, and Pd heteroatoms have been
doped into the Ag25(SR)18 template with different modes: (i)
Pd and Pt heteroatoms are doped at the center, which is the
same as in the Au25(SR)18 template; (ii) Au heteroatoms can
occupy the central position as well as the sites on the
icosahedral kernel shell in the trimetallic system. Of note, the
M1Ag24(SR)18 (M = Ag/Au/Pd/Pt) nanoclusters are of great
significance in terms of structure-property correlations at the
atomic level. Potential future work on alloying based on
Ag25(SR)18 may include: (i) exploiting other types of
heteroatoms, such as Cu, Hg, Cd, Ir, which have been
accomplished in Au25(SR)18, but not in Ag25(SR)18 yet; (ii) the
ligand effect requires further understanding as the ligands
(e.g., HS-C2H4Ph) used to prepare Au25-xMx(SR)18 cannot be
used to obtain Ag25-xMx(SR)18, and vice versa. The specific
“ligand-cluster matching” is quite intriguing and there is
much room for future work.
3.2 Alloying in Ag-based cluster of clusters
Rod-like Ag25 nanocluster is hard to be prepared due to the
relatively low stability. By contrary, a class of Ag nanoclusters
co-protected by hydrides and phosphines ligands emerge,
such as Ag18H16(PPh3)10, Ag25H22(DPPE)8, and Ag26H22(TFPP)13
(DPPE = 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)-ethane, TFPP = tris(4fluorophenyl)phosphine).443 Bootharaju et al. introduced Ptsource to the synthesis of Ag18H16(PPh3)10 nanocluster, and an
assembled bi-icosahedral Pt2Ag23(PPh3)10Cl7 nanocluster was
generated.383 Structurally, two Pt1Ag12 icosahedrons are
connected via sharing a vertex Ag atom, and the Pt2Ag23 is
capped by five bridging and two terminal Cl and ten PPh3
ligands.
Electronic
structure
simulations
further
demonstrated the enhanced stability of center-doped Pt2Ag23
nanoclusters over parent Ag25.383 Kang et al. extracted the
single icosahedral Pt1Ag12 structure from the bi-icosahedral
Pt2Ag23 nanocluster.444 Considering the remarkable influence
of the size on optical properties (mainly on optical energy
gaps), they exploited the concept of de-assembly on Pt2Ag23
nanocluster to render a blue-shift of the PL emission as well
as an enhancement in PL QY. The bi-icosahedral Pt2Ag23 was
split by a two-step ligand-exchange procedure. Firstly, ligand
exchanging Pt2Ag23 with HS-PhMe2 ligands transformed the
rod-like nanocluster into spherical Pt1Ag24(SR)18. In this step,
the Pt1Ag12 monomer was further capped by six Ag2(SR)3
staple
motifs,
resembling
Ag25.
Then,
bis(diphenylphosphino)-methane (DPPM) was used to etch the
Pt1Ag24 and the icosahedral Pt1Ag12 kernel was extracted out,
which was finally protected by five DPPM and two thiolate
ligands.444
Other alloy nanoclusters based on the assembly of
icosahedral M13 unites (linear/cyclic) are generalized here as
well. Yang et al. reported the structure of tri-icosahedral
Pt3Ag33 nanocluster.445 The combination of Pt1Ag12, Pt2Ag25,
and Pt3Ag33 nanoclusters creates an intriguing nanosystem
that implying the size-property correlations at the atomic
level.383,444,445 Assembly of two M13 icosahedrons generates
M25 bi-icosahedral nanocluster via single vertex sharing. The
assembly between three of more icosahedrons rationally

gives the corresponding tri-, tetra-, and multi-icosahedral
nanoclusters. Of note, two assembled architectures are
proposed: linear assembly and cyclic assembly. For instance,
self-assembly of three Pt1Au12 (M13) icosahedral building
blocks generates cyclic Pt3Ag33, and the central Pt atom in
each icosahedral kernel maintains. With the incorporation of
the gold heteroatoms, a tri-metallic Pt3Au12Ag21(PPh3)12Cl8
nanocluster maintaining the cyclic M36 framework was
obtained. Of note, the number of introduced gold atoms was
the same as that of the PPh3 ligands, and SC-XRD
demonstrated that Au atoms were at the peripheral sites
(linking the PPh3 ligands) of the cyclic nanocluster.445
3.3 Alloying in Ag29(S2R)12(PPh3)4 templates
There
are
two
types
of
Ag-based
M29
templates―Ag29(S2R)12(PPh3)4 and Ag29(SR)18(PPh3)4 (S2R =
1,3-benzene dithiol; SR = S-Adm).446-449 Doping based on the
Ag29(S2R)12(PPh3)4 template (Fig. 11a) is reviewed in this
section; while that on Ag29(SR)18(PPh3)4 will be discussed in
section 4.4.
Ag29(S2R)12(PPh3)4 has an icosahedral Ag13 kernel, which is
protected by an Ag16(S2R)12(PPh3)4 cage (Fig. 11a). This
Ag16(S2R)12(PPh3)4 cage is composed of four Ag3(S2R)6 motifs
and four Ag-PPh3 units. Each pair of Ag3(S2R)6 motifs shares a
S2R ligand, and thus, the total number of dithiolates is 12.
Alloying nanoclusters based on the Ag29(S2R)12(PPh3)4
nanocluster template are reviewed in Table 5. Besids, several
works have been reported on the geometric/electronic
structures and optical properties of Ag29(S2R)12(PPh3)4.450-463

Mono-Pt-doped Pt1Ag28(S2R)12(PPh3)4 was prepared via an
in-situ or a ligand-exchange approach.464,465 However, the insitu synthesis produced a mixture of Ag29 and Pt1Ag28,
whereas ligand-exchange by etching Pt2Ag23(PPh3)10Cl2 with
H2S2R generates the highly pure Pt1Ag28(S2R)12(PPh3)4 (Fig.
11b).464 Pt1Ag28(S2R)12(PPh3)4 can be prepared by ligandexchanging Pt1Ag28(SR)18(PPh3)4 with H2S2R as well.465 DFT
calculations demonstrated that the central Pt remained in the
transformation process, and the corresponding ligandexchange process just extracted an icosahedral Pt1Ag12 from
the bi-icosahedral Pt2Ag23 nanocluster and capped this kernel
with new Ag-S2R-PPh3 staple motifs.464 Besides, the crystal

Pt1Ag28(S2R)12(PPh3)4 (1.5%) could be further boosted to
17.6% (~11-fold enhancement) when the nanoclusters are
wrapped by tetraoctylammonium (TOA) counter-ions.465 TOA
counter-ions are proposed to occupy a large surface volume
on the nanocluster and make the ligand shell more rigid,
resulting in much higher PL in the Pt1Ag28(S2R)12(PPh3)4@TOA
composite material.465
Bakr and co-workers changed the mono-metallic Ag-S2RPPh3 precursor to bi-metallic Ag/Au-S2R-PPh3 precursor, and
obtained the gold-doped Ag29-xAux(S2R)12(PPh3)4 (x = 1-5)
nanoclusters.70 Of note, accompanied by Au-doping, the PL
intensity of Ag29-xAux displayed a maximum of 26-fold
enhancement (see details in Section 7).70 Determining the
precise positions of the introduced gold heteroatoms within
Ag29-xAux(S2R)12(PPh3)4 is vital to correlate the structure with
the changes to the optical properties. MS results
demonstrated that the maximum Au-doping number was
five; however, only the crystal structure of mono-Au-doped
Au1Ag28 was determined, indicating that the Au was at the
center of the icosahedral kernel (Fig. 11c). Several means
were performed to determine the precise doping positions of
the rest Au heteroatoms.70,466,467 It was found that the 31P
NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) results of Ag29-xAux
displayed a systematic shift in P signals with an increasing
amount of Au-doping.70
Theoretical predictions of Au-doping mode based on the
Ag29(S2R)12(PPh3)4 template were performed to understand
the molecular and physical origins of the doping-induced PL
enhancement.466,467 The Häkkinen group theoretically
predicted the most favorable doping sites of Au heteroatoms
by exploiting DFT and linear-response time-dependent DFT

(LR-TDDFT) methods.466 An enhancement in the electronic
transitions at ~450 nm indicated the formation of Au-PPh3
bond in AuxAg29-x(S2R)12(PPh3)4, which agreed with
experiment.70,466 In addition, the formation of Au-P bonds
prevented the nanocluster from degradation, since the AuPPh3 bond was stronger by 0.4 eV than Ag-PPh3 bond.466 By
comparison, Xie et al. computationally explored the
electronic and geometric structures of Ag29 and Ag29-xAux (x =
1-5) nanoclusters in the S0 and S1 states.467 DFT calculations
also proved that the enhanced PL intensity and thermalstability resulted from Au substitution. Specifically, (i) the
relativistic effects of the introduced Au played a significant
role in enhancing the PL intensity, which was more obvious
when increasing the Au number to 3-5; (ii) the newly formed
Au-Au bonds resulted in the enhanced thermal-stability of
Ag29-xAux relative to Ag29.467
The Cu-doped M29(S2R)12(PPh3)4 nanoclusters were also
controllably synthesized and structurally determined.468
Involving Cu in the precursor during the preparation of
Ag29(S2R)12(PPh3)4 resulted in the Ag17Cu12(S2R)12(PPh3)4
nanocluster, while reducing the Au/Ag/Cu-based precursor
gave rise to Au1Ag16Cu12(S2R)12(PPh3)4 (Fig. 11d). Besides,
metal-exchanging Ag17Cu12(S2R)12(PPh3)4 with AuI(PPh3)Cl also
produced the same Au1Ag16Cu12(S2R)12(PPh3)4.468 Structurally,
the introduced Au is preferentially incorporated at the center
of the icosahedral M13 kernel, whereas Cu heteroatoms are
arranged in the metal-S2R motifs, converting the previous
Ag12(S2R)12(PPh3)4 cage into a novel Cu12(S2R)12(PPh3)4 cage
(Fig. 11d).468 All the nanoclusters in the M29(S2R)12(PPh3)4
family contain four C3 axes that all pass through the M-PPh3
units (Fig. 11d).468

Hydrophilic Ag29 nanoclusters are prepared by hydrophilic
dithiols. Several works have been reported in terms of
preparations (syntheses and purification), properties
(isomerism, stability, and luminescence), and applications
(antibacterial and antifungal) so far.469-473 DFT calculations
demonstrated that hydrophilic Ag29 possessed similar
structures as Ag29(S2R)12(PPh3)4.473 In 2018, the Mattoussi
group reported Ag29-xAux(DHLA)12 nanocluster (DHLA =
dihydrolipoic acid) with a 6-fold enhancement in PL
compared with its Ag29 counterpart.474 Such an Au-doping
induced PL enhancement agreed with the phenomena in
hydrophobic
Ag29-xAux
nanoclusters.70
Besides,
the
hydrophilic M29(DHLA)12 is only capped by the dithiolate
ligands, which is consistent with M29(S2R)12 obtained by an insitu synthesis in the absence of phosphine source.70,446
Furthermore, owing to the terminal acid group of the DHLA
ligand, further functionalization has been performed on these
hydrophilic nanoclusters.474
Collectively, Au and Pt has been successfully doped into
the icosahedral M13 kernel of Ag29(S2R)12(PPh3)4, but crystal
structures of Ag29-xAux(S2R)12(PPh3)4 (x > 1) are still needed as
there is inconsistency in theoretical predictions. The boost in
PL based on doping is intriguing and worth further studies,
and understanding the significant role of the central
heteroatom in the frontier orbitals requires more
experimental and theoretical work.
3.4 Alloying based on icosahedral Ag44(SR)30 nanocluster
The Ag44(SR)30 was first synthesized in 2009,475 and is one of
the most studied silver nanoclusters protected by all thiolates.
In the following years, several works were reported focusing
on the large-scale synthesis,476-481 ligand engineering,476478,481-485 self-assembly,483,486-488 and alloying. The structure of
Ag44(SR)30 was determined in 2013,476,477 revealing an
icosahedral Ag12 kernel (hollow, c.f. the centered icosahedral
M13 kernel discussed before) capped by an Ag32(SR)30 cage
(composed of a decahedral Ag20 and six Ag2(SR)5 motifs) (Fig.
12a). The Zheng group reported several structures of Ag44
and Au12Ag32 protected by different thiolate ligands, including
S-PhF, S-PhF2, and S-PhCF3.477,489 SC-XRD results of Au12Ag32
demonstrated that Au heteroatoms formed an Au12 kernel
shell (Fig. 12a, bottom).477 Theoretical calculations also
demonstrated the preferred kernel occupation by the
introduced Au heteroatoms.477,490,491 Specifically, the relative
energy was the lowest when 12 kernel sites were completely
occupied by Au.490 Based on the Ag44(SR)30 template (SR = pMBA, p-mercaptobenzoic acid ligand), Bigioni and co-workers
investigated the full range alloying of AuxAg44-x(SR)30
nanoclusters (0 ≤ x ≤ 12).492 DFT calculations also provided
insights into the Au/Ag composition-dependent electronic
structures and chemical properties (especially reactivity).492

Besides doping into the M12 icosahedral kernel, Au
heteroatoms are also found to substitute the Ag atoms in the
six Ag2(SR)5 motifs.493 Based on the [Ag44(SR)30-xClx]4- (SR = pMBA) template, Xie and co-workers presented a delicate and
well-controlled surface metal-exchange reaction, which used
the Au(I)-SR complexes to precisely substitute the initial Ag(I)SR surface motifs to obtain Ag32Au12(SR)30. Different from
[Au12Ag32(SR)30]4- with a kernel-doping mode, the
configuration of [Ag32Au12(SR)30]4- could be viewed as
Ag12(kernel)@Ag20(middle shell)@6×Au2(SR)5(surface motif)
(Fig. 12a, bottom-right).493 Theoretical calculations suggested
that the thermodynamically less favorable Ag@Au core-shell
configuration was kinetically stabilized by the decahedral Ag20
shell, which further prevented inward diffusion of the surface
Au heteroatoms. Owing to the synergism between Au and Ag,
[Ag32Au12(SR)30]4- displayed an enhanced thermal-stability
relative to [Ag44(SR)30]4-, and did not decompose for more
than 30 days at room temperature or more than 2 hours at
150oC.493
The Xie group reported another inward diffusion process
in which a single Au atom goes from the staple motif to the
kernel’s shell, and finally to the center of Ag25.436 We also
note
that
both
[Au12@Ag32(SR)30]4and
[Ag12@Ag20Au12(SR)30]4- have the same formula but with
different configurations as reported,477,493 and their
absorption spectra are very similar to each other. Thus, it is
still an open question why the Au atoms would stop moving
inside in the case of Ag44.82
In summary, based on the Ag44(SR)30 nanocluster, several
alloying achievements have been reported: (i) Au12Ag32(SR)30
nanoclusters (stabilized by different thiolate ligands) are
obtained; (ii) the syntheses of full range doped AuxAg44-x(pMBA)30 nanoclusters (x = 1-12) are developed; (iii) two
different Au-doping modes are observed: kernel doping
mode and motif doping mode; (iv) size-growth from
Ag44(SR)30 to Ag50(SR)30(DPPM)6 and then metal-exchange led
to AuxAg50-x(SR)30(DPPM)6. The [Ag44(SR)30]4- (18 e) and
[Ag25(SR)18]- (8 e) nanoclusters are both considered to be
superatoms.435,477 The [Ag25(SR)18]- has a center that can be
replaced by group-10 elements when one more electron is
trapped on the cluster to maintain the 8 e electron
configuration. But [Ag44(SR)30]4- does not have a center and
already has a charge state of -4. The 18 e superatom
configuration of this template might restrict heteroatoms
from doping, especially as they might break the 18e
electronic structure. As [Au25(SR)18]- (8 e) can be altered to 7
e and 6 e with partially occupied superatom orbital by
oxidation or Pt/Pd doping,211,222,494,495 it would be interesting
to use alloying to reveal more cases with different
superatomic HOMO and LUMO.

Fig. 13 Au-alloying based on the Ag20/Ag21 templates. Structures of Se-Ag21, S-Ag21, S-Ag20, and Se-Ag20 nanoclusters, and their
corresponding doped Se-Au1Ag20, S-Au1Ag20, S-Au1Ag19, and Se-Au3Ag18 nanoclusters.
By comparison, the Au-alloying mode based on Se-Ag20
was different ― the result was a multi-Au-doped Se-Au3Ag18
nanocluster.501 The cluster size increased from M20 to M21 in
this alloying process, and a large structural transformation
was found. Specifically, the “spherical” Se-Ag20 is altered into
a “tetrahedral” shape. The Au atoms were arranged into
different sites in the icosahedral M13 kernel: one Au occupied
the center, and the other two were on the kernel shell.501
Collectively, the mono-Au-doped counterparts of S-Ag20, SAg21, and Se-Au21 were successfully prepared without
structural transformation, while Au-alloying on Se-Ag20
output Se-Au3Ag18 nanocluster. Thus, the mono-doped SeAu1Ag19 and its structure could be the next synthetic target.
In 2019, the Liu group reported the direct syntheses and
structural determinations of two dithiolate-protected Pd/Ag
nanoclusters
―
Pd1Ag20{S2P(OnPr)2}12
and
n
503
Pd6Ag14(S){S2P(O Pr)2}12.
The preparations could be
controlled by altering the Pd/Ag ratio and reaction times.
Structurally, Pd1Ag20{S2P(OnPr)2}12 is an 8e superatom
isoelectronic to [Ag21{S2P(OiPr)2}12]+, and comprises a Pd1Ag12
icosahedral kernel capped by an Ag8{S2P(OnPr)2}12 shell. The
twelve S2P(OnPr)2 ligands are equally distributed in three
layers (top, middle and bottom) along a pseudo-C2 axis.503
The structure of Pd6Ag14(S){S2P(OnPr)2}12 exhibits a sulfidecentered S-Pd6Ag2 rhombohedron surrounded by 12
additional Ag atoms with S6 symmetry. Of note,
Pd6Ag14(S){S2P(OnPr)2}12 is the first reported alloy nanocluster
with an octahedral hexa-palladium(0) kernel embodied within
a silver(I) cluster.503
Pt1Ag20{S2P(OPr)2}12 has also been reported.504 The metal
framework contains an icosahedral Pt1Ag12 kernel, which is
capped by eight Ag atoms, giving rise to a Pt1Ag20 of idealized
C2 symmetry. The Pt1Ag20 is further stabilized by 12 S2P(OPr)2
ligands.504 Furthermore, by slightly altering the synthetic
route, two “cluster-of-clusters” type Pt/Ag alloys were
obtained,
namely,
[Pt2Ag33{S2P(OPr)2}17]
and

[Pt3Ag44{S2P(OPr)2}22. The three Pt-alloyed nanoclusters
(Pt1Ag20, Pt2Ag33, and Pt3Ag44) contain 8, 16, and 22 free
electron counts, respectively.504 The crystal structures reveal
that their inner kernels (Pt1Ag12, Pt2Ag23, and Pt3Ag34) can be
visualized as consisting of one, two and three Pt-centered
icosahedral Pt1Ag12, respectively. In Pt2Ag33 and Pt3Ag44
nanoclusters, the Pt1Ag12 units are vertex-shared and
assembled linearly, which are isolobal to N2 and I3-,
respectively.504
Collectively, the Au-alloying has been achieved based on
both Ag20 and Ag21 nanoclusters stabilized by S/Se donor
ligands. As for the Ag21 template, the central Pd- and Ptdoping processes were accomplished. The surface structure
formed by Ag and S/Se donor ligands is different from that in
Ag25(SR)18 although their superatomic configurations are
similar.

4 Alloy nanoclusters of specific sizes
Besides the above-mentioned alloy nanoclusters based on
templates, several special alloys have been reported with
specific magic-size kernels, such as Ag28Cu12 and Ag32Cd12
with tetrahedral Ag28 kernel; Au13Cu2, Au13Cu4 and Au13Cu8
nanoclusters with icosahedral Au13 kernel; Au12Cu32, Au14Cu32,
Au16Cu32 and Au18Cu32 nanoclusters with icosahedral Au12
kernel; Pt-centered Pt1Ag26 and Pt1Ag28 nanoclusters; and
M1Cu12 nanoclusters. In this section, these alloy nanoclusters
are highlighted. Most of these alloy nanoclusters share one
thing in common: the minority atom(s) are symmetrically
arranged in the structure, e.g., at the centre, or mounted at
equal positions on the surface of the kernel.
4.1 Nanoclusters with tetrahedral Ag28 kernel
Yan et al. reported the crystal structure of
[Ag28Cu12(SR)24]4-, which was the first Ag/Cu nanocluster with
structure solved (Fig. 14a).505 The high yield and stability of

this alloy nanocluster were proposed to result from its 20electron count. Structurally, Ag28Cu12 contains a threeconcentric
shell
structure:
Ag4(kernel)@Ag24(shell)@4×Cu3(SR)6(motifs).
The
arrangement of Ag(inner)@Cu(surface) is proposed to result
from the activities of the two metals, i.e. Ag is more inert and
thus goes to the kernel, whereas Cu is more active and thus
preferentially resides in surface motifs for wrapping the Ag
kernel.505 Interestingly, Ag28Cu12(SR)24 is in a “-4” charge state
and has a chiral metal framework with T symmetry; thus, the
contains an FCC Ag28 and HCP Ag-Cu interface. The
Ag28Cu12(SR)24 prepared using achiral counter-ion, nBu4N, is a
racemic mixture, hence no CD signal. By altering the achiral
counter-ion to chiral quaternary ammonium salts, such as Nbenzylcinchonidinium
chloride
(BCDC)
or
Nbenzylcinchoninium chloride (BCNC), counter-ion-pairing
enantioseparation and direct asymmetric synthesis have
been put forward for in-situ preparing chiral nanoclusters.505

Bootharaju et al. reported Cd-alloyed Ag32Cd12(SePh)36 ―
which consists of an Ag28 kernel stabilized by four
Ag1Cd3(SePh)9 motifs (Fig. 14b).506 The Ag28 kernel contains
an innermost Ag4 tetrahedron, which is encapsulated by four
Ag6 facets; and this configuration is the same as that in
Ag28Cu12.506 Besides, in the Ag1Cd3(SePh)9 motif structure,
each Cd atom tetrahedrally coordinates with four SePh
ligands, and three of the Se atoms in the CdSe4 tetrahedra
bind to the Ag atom on the top to form an AgSe3 cap-like
structure, giving rise to Ag1Cd3(SePh)9 motif structure. The
four Ag1Cd3(SePh)9 motifs cap the four Ag6 kernel facets with
a one-on-one mode via Se-Ag linkages. The absorption
spectrum and electronic structure of this cluster are well
consistent with those from DFT calculations.506
4.2 Nanoclusters with centered icosahedral Au13 kernel
The Zheng group reported a correlated series of Au/Cu alloy
nanoclusters with Au13Cux (x = 2, 4, 8) compositions.507 By
engineering the peripheral ligands (mainly by introducing the
N coordination sites), different numbers of Cu heteroatoms
were arranged onto the surface of the icosahedral Au13
kernel (Fig. 15a). Specifically, when the Au/Cu nanocluster
was co-stabilized by PPh3 and Spy ligands (Spy = 2-pyridyl),
Au13Cu2(PPh3)6(Spy)6 was generated (Fig. 15a, left). The two
Cu heteroatoms were at the two ends on the cluster surface.
Changing the capped ligands to PPh2py and SPhtBu produced
Au13Cu4(PPh2py)4(SPhtBu)8 (Fig. 15a, middle). A regular
tetrahedron was formed via linking the four Cu atoms, which
encircled the icosahedral Au13 kernel. In addition,
Au13Cu8(Spy)12 emerged with Spy ligand only (Fig. 15a, right)
and the overall structure was in an irregular manner with C1
symmetry.507 Of note, all of these Cu atoms display a μ6
binding mode: each Cu atom links to three gold atoms on the
icosahedral Au13 kernel shell and another three atoms in the
ligands (N or S).507
Due to the different Cu alloying modes and Cu numbers
among these Au/Cu alloy nanoclusters, each nanocluster
shows different optical absorption although they share the
same Au13 kernel.507 This is can be understood by the fact
that the Cu atoms or Cu-containing motifs are directly
mounted on the Au13 kernel via Cu-Au bonds (2.75-3.05 Å),
thus, Cu would be more significantly involved in the frontier
orbitals and accordingly change the electronic states. A
similar phenomenon is also observed in other Au/Cu alloy
nanoclusters with Au13 kernels (vide infra), but the change in
motifs far away from the kernel would have less influences
(see section 4.3).

Deng et al. changed the PPh3 ligands in the preparation of
Au13Cu2(PPh3)6(Spy)6
nanocluster
to
1,3bis(diphenyphosphino)propane
(DPPP),
and
obtained
Au13Cu2(DPPP)3(Spy)6
(Fig.
15b).508
The
phosphine
coordination sites on these two nanoclusters were the same
(6 total). When the achiral DPPP ligands were replaced by
chiral
(2r,4r)/(2s,4s)-2,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)pentane
(BDPP) ligands, two optically pure enantiomers Au13Cu2(2r,4rBDPP)3(SPy)6
and
Au13Cu2(2s,4s-BDPP)3(SPy)6
were
synthesized.508
In 2019, Zhou et al. reported a new Au13Cu2 nanocluster
co-protected by PhC2H4-SH and PPh3 ligands, formulated as
Au13Cu2(PPh3)6(S-C2H4Ph)6 (Fig. 15c).509 Although the Cu
heteroatoms are fixed by Cu-S interactions in
Au13Cu2(PPh3)6(S-C2H4Ph)6, rather than Cu-N interactions in
Au13Cu2(PPh3)6(Spy)6, both Au13Cu2 nanoclusters contain the
same icosahedral Au13 kernel.507,509 Such surface differences
between the two nanoclusters induce tremendous changes in
optical absorption.509
Based on the Au13Cu4(PPh2py)4(SR)8 nanocluster, Song et
al. altered the thiol to selenol ligands.510 An
Au13Cu4(PPh2py)3(SePh)9 nanocluster was obtained with a
configuration
of
Au13(kernel)@3×Cu(SePh)2PPh2py&Cu(SePh)3(motifs)
(Fig.
15d) with remarkable differences in terms of motif structure
compared with Au13Cu4(PPh2py)4(SR)8. ESI-MS results
demonstrated a reaction intermediate formulated as

Au13Cu4(PPh2py)4(SeR)8, with the same metal-ligand
composition as the Au13Cu4(PPh2py)4(SR)8. However, probably
due to the low thermal-stability of this reaction intermediate,
an additional SePh ligand would further substitute one
PPh2py ligand on the surface to generate the final
product―Au13Cu4(PPh2py)3(SePh)9.510
4.3 Nanocluster with hollow icosahedral Au12 kernel
Through controlling the feeding material in the synthesis,
Yang et al. obtained a series of all-thiolate stabilized
nanoclusters ― Au12+nCu32(SR)30+2n (n = 0, 2, 4, 6) (Fig. 15f).511
First of all, the configuration of Au12Cu32(SR)30 (n = 0) is
almost the same as that of Au12Ag32(SR)30,477 in which the
icosahedral Au12 kernel is capped by a Cu20 shell and further
protected by three pairs of Cu2(SR)5 motifs.511 Of note, each
pair of Cu2(SR)5 motifs can be replaced by a pair of
Cu2Au1(SR)6 motifs (at contrapuntal sites); alternatively, the
Cu2Au1(SR)6 motif can be considered as inserting an Au1(SR)
unit into the Cu2(SR)5 motif, and consequently, a correlated
series of nanoclusters ― Au12Cu32(SR)30, Au14Cu32(SR)32,
Au16Cu32(SR)34, and Au18Cu32(SR)36 ― was obtained. Different
metal compositions and surface structures hardly changed
the optical absorption in this series, but there is a large
difference in thermal stability, i.e. Au12Cu32(SR)30 and
Au14Cu32(SR)32 are much thermally stable than the other two
nanoclusters. Zheng and co-workers analyzed the oxidation
process based on Au16Cu32(SR)34, and obtained the crystal

structure of its decomposed product―Au13Cu12(SR)20, which
contained an icosahedral Au13 kernel capped by two Cu6(SR)10
triangle-like motifs (Fig. 15e).511
4.4 Pt-centered nanoclusters
Controllably tuning the structures of nanoclusters with
atomic precision is important for tailoring their
chemical/physical properties and developing their practical
applications. Wu and co-workers altered the capping ligand in
the synthesis of Pt1Ag24(SR)18 and obtained a larger Ptcentered, Ag-based alloy nanocluster, i.e. Pt1Ag26(SR)18(PPh3)4
(Fig. 16a).512 Structurally, the Pt1Ag12 kernel in Pt1Ag24(SR)18
grew into a Pt1Ag14 kernel and the structures of peripheral
motifs also changed. Interestingly, dissimilar optical and
electrochemical gaps were found for these two nanoclusters.
Both Pt1Ag24 and Pt1Ag26 nanoclusters are 8e superatoms and
exhibit highly similar electronic structures illustrated by their
almost superimposable optical absorption and similar
HOMO/LUMO locations. However, largely different
electrochemical gaps were observed: Pt1Ag28 (1.89 eV) vs.
Pt1Ag24 (1.48 eV), which was probably resulted from the
differences in charges of the Pt1Ag12/Pt1Ag14 kernels.512
In 2019, Wu and co-workers obtained the structures of
co-crystallized Au1Ag24(SR)18 and Au1Ag26(SR)18(PPh3)6
nanoclusters in one crystal lattice,513 and the cocrystallization was induced by weak electrostatic interactions
between cationic [Au1Ag26(SR)18(PPh3)6]+ and anionic
[Au1Ag24(SR)18]- nanoclusters as well as the C-H···π and π···π
interactions.513 The Au1Ag26(SR)18(PPh3)6 with Au center is a
structural analogue of Pt1Ag26(SR)18(PPh3)4 (Fig. 16a,
right).512,513
Among the nanoclusters in the M29(SR)18(PPh3)4 library
(where SR = S-Adm), the Pt-centered Pt1Ag28 are the most
researched, and the multi-metallic M29 will be discussed in
Section 5.2. Pt1Ag28(SR)18(PPh3)4 was firstly obtained by
ligand-exchange on Pt1Ag24(SPhMe2)18, and the Pt1Ag12 kernel
of Pt1Ag28(SR)18(PPh3)4 was a distorted FCC configuration (Fig.
16b).447 Lin et al. prepared the Pt1Ag28(SR)18(PPh3)4
nanocluster by in-situ reducing Pt/Ag-SR-PPh3 complexes.
Interestingly, the nanocluster contains a Pt1Ag12 kernel with
standard FCC configuration (Fig. 16b, right).449 Although the
two Pt1Ag28(SR)18(PPh3)4 nanoclusters showed the same
composition, the different kernel structures endowed them
with different optical properties.447,449
Kang et al. reported another Pt1Ag28 nanocluster that was
co-stabilized by HS-c-C6H11 and PPh3 ligands, Pt1Ag28(S-cC6H11)18(PPh3)4, by ligand-exchanging the Pt1Ag28(SAdm)18(PPh3)4 with excess HS-c-C6H11 ligands.514 Of note, the
reversible process (i.e., from Pt1Ag28(S-c-C6H11)18(PPh3)4 to
Pt1Ag28(S-Adm)18(PPh3)4) was also feasible. Interestingly,
although both Pt1Ag28(SR)18(PPh3)4 nanoclusters contain
similar Ag16(SR)18(PPh3)4 cages, their Pt1Ag12 kernel are
different — Pt1Ag28(S-Adm)18(PPh3)4 contains an FCC Pt1Ag12
kernel, whereas the Pt1Ag28(S-c-C6H11)18(PPh3)4 contains an
icosahedral Pt1Ag12 kernel.514 Such a reversible kernel
structure (FCC and icosahedral isomers) is new (Fig. 16c). A
combination of UV-vis, ESI-MS, PL, and XAFS unambiguously

identified that the FCC-to-icosahedral transformation of the
Pt1Ag28 kernel involves two distinct stages: (i) the ligandexchange induced motif change, and (ii) the abrupt kernel
transformation.514 Such a structural transformation (FCC vs.
icosahedron) results in significant differences in both optical
absorption and PL emission.514

Starting from Pt1Ag28(S-Adm)18(PPh3)4, the addition of
Ag2(DPPM)Cl2 was exploited to re-construct the surface
structure of the nanocluster, which produced a larger size
nanocluster ― Pt1Ag31(SR)16(DPPM)3Cl3.515 Structurally, the
size growth was induced by the substitution of Ag-PPh3
terminals in Pt1Ag28(S-Adm)18(PPh3)4 with Ag2(DPPM)Cl
terminals.515 The substitution of cluster terminals induces
direct changes to the surface structure (size-growth,
structure transformation, and surface rotation) as well as
indirect changes to the kernel structure (from a FCC
configuration to an icosahedral configuration).515

Altering HS-Adm to HS-2-Adm (2-adamantanethiol) in the
synthesis of Pt1Ag28(S-Adm)18(PPh3)4 gives rise to both
Pt1Ag28(S-2-Adm)20 and Pt1Ag28(S-2-Adm)18(HO-SR)2 (Fig.
16d).516 For the latter, the valence self-regulation of sulfur
from “-2” valence state in thiols (i.e., Ag-SR) to the “-1”
valence state in hydroxylated thiolates (i.e., HO-SR-Ag) has
been accomplished; this is the first time that the “-1” valent
sulfur, i.e. “S-1” is detected. Both nanoclusters have
icosahedral Pt1Ag12 kernels, whereas the Ag-SR cages of them
are different ― the cage of Pt1Ag28(S-2-Adm)20 comprises an
Ag10(SR)10 ring motif, two Ag2(SR)3 and two Ag1(SR)1 staple
motifs, while that of Pt1Ag28(S-2-Adm)18(HO-SR)2 is composed
of an Ag8(SR)10 ring motif plus two Ag2(SR)3 and two
Ag2(SR)1(HO-SR)1 staple motifs.516 SC-XRD revealed that these
two nanoclusters were lamellar co-crystallized (with a 1:1
ratio) in the crystal lattice with an interlayer distance of
33.978 Å (calculated from the distance between two Pt
planes). ESI-MS analysis was performed to verify their cocrystallization, as well as the presence of the hydroxyl on the
nanocluster surface.516
4.5 M1Cu12 nanoclusters
In 2016, Liu and co-workers reported a two-electron homocopper nanocluster superatom with a chemical formula of
Cu13(S2CNnBu2)6(C≡CR)4 (R = C(O)OMe or C6H4F).517
Structurally, the cuboctahedral Cu13 contains eight triangular
faces (capped by acetylide groups) and six square faces
(protected by di-thiolate ligands) (Fig. 17). DFT calculations
demonstrated that the a1 HOMO contains two 1S jellium
electrons, which is a two-electron superatom.517 Silalahi et al.
found that the central Cu atom could be substituted by Ag or
Au heteroatom via reacting the Cu13 solution with M+ ions,
giving M1@Cu12(S2CNnBu2)6(C≡CR)4 (M = Au/Ag) (Fig. 17).518
However, mainly because the atomic radii of Au and Ag are
larger than that of Cu, the Ag-Cu and Cu-Cu (or the Au-Cu and
Cu-Cu) bond lengths in Ag1Cu12 (or Au1Cu12) are slightly
longer than those in homo-copper Cu13 nanocluster. These
experimental and theoretical results revealed that the Au and
Ag dopants (i) enhance the stability, (ii) alter the optical
absorption, and (iii) significantly improve the PL performance
in Au1Cu12 and Ag1Cu12 relative to the Cu13.518 Specifically, the
PL QY of Au1Cu12 at 77 K is about 59%.518 Chakrahari et al.
expanded the scope of the central atom to S, Br and Cl
atoms.519

5 Multi-metallic nanoclusters
Doping has been considered as a versatile approach to
control the compositions, regulate the electronic and
geometric structures, and tune the chemical and physical
properties of nanoclusters. Doping more than one type of
hetero-metal into homo-gold or homo-silver nanoclusters is
more challenging but has met with some successes. Here we
review the literature progress in multi-metallic nanoclusters
containing ≥3 types of metals.
5.1 Spherical and Rod M25 systems
The most studied templates for multi-metallic alloying are
spherical M25 and rod-like M25 (M = Au/Ag) nanoclusters
(Table 6; and see the bi-metallic systems in sections 2.1 and
2.5).378-381,442,520-524 Negishi et al. has an excellent review on
these systems (mainly on Au-based M25 nanoclusters).82 Here
we only briefly highlight some results on Ag-based M25
systems.

As the icosahedral M13 kernels can easily be center-doped
by Pt/Pd, tri-metallic nanoclusters could be prepared by
further doping the Pd/Pt-centered icosahedral kernel shell
with Au/Ag dopants. In addition, due to the improved
stability by the central Pt heteroatom, the tri-metallic
nanoclusters are generally stable and follow a stratified
configuration―Pt(center)@Ag/Au(kernel shell). Based on this
consideration, several phosphine/halogen co-protected trimetallic nanoclusters have been prepared, such as
Pt1Au12Ag12(PPh3)10Cl7,
Ni1Au12Ag12(PPh3)10Cl7,
Pt2Au10Ag13(PPh3)10Cl7, etc.379-381
Based on the center-Pt-doped Pt1Ag24(SR)18, Kang et al.
exploited the metal-exchange strategy to prepare Pt/Au/Ag
tri-metallic nanoclusters with different structures.378 Reacting
spherical Pt1Ag24(SR)18 with Au-SR complexes generated
Pt1Ag24-xAux(SR)18 with the maintained structure, i.e. the
Pt(center)@Au/Ag(kernel
shell)@Ag(motif)
tri-stratified

arrangement. Both SC-XRD and ESI-MS results demonstrated
that the average Au doping number in Pt1Ag24-xAux(SR)18 was
6.4.378 However, reacting Pt1Ag24(SR)18 with a large amount of
Au(PPh3)Br complexes altered the spherical shape to rod-like
shape, i.e. a bi-icosahedral Pt2Au10Ag13(PPh3)10Br7 nanocluster,
with a multi-layered configuration of Ag-Au5-Pt1-Ag5-Ag1-Ag5Pt1-Au5-Ag1.378 The different metal-exchanging results
(structure-maintained vs. structure-altered) might be caused
by the different ligand effects between thiol and
phosphine.378
Adding only a small amount of Au(PPh3)Cl to Pt1Ag24(SR)18
did not cause structural transformation, but one or two Au
heteroatoms were doped into the Pt1Ag12 icosahedral kernel
shell, giving rise to Pt1Ag23Au1(SR)18 or Pt1Ag22Au2(SR)18
nanoclusters.442 Thus, there should be a threshold for the
M25(SR)18 nanocluster to maintain its spherical shape under
the attack by Au(PPh3)Cl.378,442
The phenomenon in reacting Pd1Ag24(SR)18 with
Au(PPh3)Cl complex is different.442 ESI-MS identified the
products as bi-metallic Au1Ag24(SR)18 and Au2Ag23(SR)18
nanoclusters instead of the tri-metallic ones; that is, the
central Pd atom was substituted by the introduced Au
heteroatom. Bootharaju et al. proposed that such a
replacement process was similar to the “Ag25(SR)18 →
Au1Ag24(SR)18” doping process.442 Specifically, the introduced
Au heteroatom was first arranged onto the icosahedral kernel
shell, and then exchanged with the center Pd atom.442 The
differences in Au doping processes for Pt1Ag24 and Pd1Ag24
nanoclusters could be explained in terms of variations in the
stability of the Pt/Pd center against the attack from the
incoming Au.442

methods.
Among
these
21
M29
nanoclusters,
Pt1Ag12Cu12Au4(SR)18(PPh3)4 and Pd1Ag12Cu12Au4(SR)18(PPh3)4
are indeed the first reports of tetra-metallic nanoclusters of
atomic precision. The atomic mono-dispersity of each
nanocluster has been confirmed by ESI-MS analysis. Based on
this M29 library, the synergetic effects on optical properties
and thermal stability have been mapped out, which will be
discussed in Section 7.448
Of note, there are great differences in doping modes
between Ag29(S2R)12(PPh3)4 and Ag29(SR)18(PPh3)4) due to the
different kernel configurations (FCC vs. icosahedron) and the
surface structures. Future alloying work based upon these
two M29 templates will give more insights into the kernel
configuration effects and ligand effects in the doping process.

5.2 M29 system

5.3 Other systems

As for the Ag29(S-Adm)18(PPh3)4 nanocluster (of note, its
structure remains undetermined, but is predicted from the
structures of other M29(S-Adm)18(PPh3)4 nanoclusters), the
FCC Ag13 kernel is capped by an Ag16(SR)18(PPh3)4 cage. Kang
et al. constructed a library of M29(S-Adm)18(PPh3)4 (M =
Au/Ag/Pd/Pt/Cu) nanoclusters with composition ranging
from mono-metallic to tetra-metallic (Fig. 18), and atomically
precise manipulation on each site.448 These nanoclusters
were prepared step by step with in-situ synthesis, target
metal-exchange and forced metal-exchange methods, and
this stepwise procedure guaranteed the mono-dispersity of
these nanoclusters, resulting in Ag29, Pt1Ag28, Pt1Ag12Cu16,
Pt1Ag12Cu12Au4, etc.448 Specifically, the M29(S-Adm)18(PPh3)4
template possesses a tetra-stratified configuration:
M1(center)@M12(1st-shell)@M12(SR)18(2nd-shell)@(AgPPh3)4(vertex), and owing to the accessibility of each site with
multi-choices of metals, a rich library of 21 species of M29
clusters was successfully prepared: the occupation by
Ag/Au/Pt/Pd at the center, and the occupation by Ag/Cu on
the cuboctahedral kernel shell (2nd-shell) can be both
controlled by in-situ syntheses, while the control over the
vertex atom (the four sites linking to PPh3 in the
Ag16(SR)18(PPh3)4 cage) occupation by Ag/Cu/Au is achieved
via the target metal-exchange and the forced metal-exchange

Except the M25 and M29 systems, other tri-metallic
nanoclusters have been studied as well.525-527 Puls et al.
reported the structure of Ni1(AuPPh3)(8-2n)(AuCl)3(AlCp*)n (Cp*
= C5Me5 and n = 1, 2) based on the icosahedral Au13
template.525 This tri-metallic nanocluster was prepared by the
transmetalation of Ni(AlCp*)4 with Au(PPh3)Cl. In the
structure of Ni1Au9Al1, the Ni or Al heteroatom is
incorporated at the center or on the surface of an incomplete
icosahedral kernel. When two Al heteroatoms are doped into
the template, the icosahedral configuration of Ni1Au7Al2
becomes more defective. By similar synthetic procedures, the
central and surface Au atoms can be substituted by the
introduced Mo and Ga atoms, respectively, resulting in a trimetallic nanocluster with a Mo(center)@Au8(PMe3)8Ga4Cl7
configuration.525
Zheng and co-workers reported an alkynyl-protected
Ag8Au7(C≡CtBu)12 nanocluster, which follows a three-layer
Au1@Ag8@Au6(C≡CtBu)12 configuration.526 When copper was
added during the synthesis, some of the peripheral Au could
be substituted by Cu, producing tri-metallic Ag8Au7t

xCux(C≡C Bu)12 nanoclusters (x up to 6).

6 Other alloy nanoclusters
Aside from the aforementioned nanocluster systems, alloy
nanoclusters with specific structures have been synthesized
and determined. In this section, we select some works of
recently published alloy nanoclusters. Together with those
discussed in previous sections, the combination will provide
readers with a comprehensive view on the alloying modes of
different metals, novel structures and properties that alloying
can bring about.
Similar to section 4, atoms of the same kind tend to
arrange according to the symmetry of the nanocluster
structure. For smaller sizes, central occupation and
symmetrically sparse surface distribution for minor atom(s)
are observed, whereas for larger sizes, different atoms prefer
to form a shell-by-shell autonomy.
6.1 Au/Ag alloy nanoclusters
In addition to the aforementioned Au/Ag alloy nanoclusters
(section 2-5), there are many more of them with specific
alloying modes and overall structures, which are reviewed
herein and divided into three categories according to their

medium size (nanoclusters contain 25-50 metal atoms), and

6.1.1 Au/Ag alloy nanoclusters of up to 25 metal atoms
Jin et al. reported a small-sized Au/Ag nanocluster coprotected by DPPM and S-Adm ligands with a chemical
formula of Au4Ag5(DPPM)2(S-Adm)6.528 In the Au4Ag5, an Ag5
central plane is penetrated by an Au2 unit which is further
linked by the other two Au atoms (Fig. 19a). SC-XRD identified
two chiral isomers in the unit cell. Interestingly, although
Au4Ag5 in the solution phase is non-emissive, strong PL is
induced when Au4Ag5 nanoclusters are in solid state
(amorphous or crystals). Such an AIE phenomenon could be
attributed to the tight combination of left- and right-handed
enantiomers in solid state, which induces a strong restriction
on intramolecular motions (RIM).528
The Wang group obtained two small-sized Au/Ag alloy
nanoclusters—Au6Ag2(PPh2py)6
and
Au10Ag2(2-pyC≡C)3(PPh2py)6.529 As shown in Fig. 19b, Au6Ag2 adopts the μ6Ag binding mode, i.e. each Ag is linked to three N donors in
PPh2py ligand and three Au atoms. As for Au10Ag2, two Ag
heteroatoms are anchored to the two terminals of Au10, and
the integrate structure of Au10Ag2 displays C3h symmetry.
Three 2-py-C≡C ligands encircle the central Au10, whereas the
PPh2py ligands are only at the terminal positions to anchor
the Ag heteroatoms (Fig. 19c).529 Of note, Au10Ag2 shows
intense red-NIR dual emissions at 653 nm and 971 nm in
solution. The emission at 653 nm is proposed to originate
from the process of metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT)
from Ag to phosphine ligands, whereas the NIR emission (971
nm) is associated with the participation of PPh2py ligands in
the frontier orbitals of Au10Ag2.529
Wen et al. reported a linear cluster-based polymer by
assembling
Au7Ag8(DPPF)3(CF3CO2)7
(DPPF
=
1,1’bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene) entities via covalent Ag-O
bonds, resulting in [Au7Ag9(DPPF)3(CF3CO2)7BF4]n.530 In the
building block of Au7Ag8, the icosahedral Au@Au6Ag6 kernel
following an Ag3-Au7-Ag3 three-layer fashion is further
capped by two Ag atoms. Two adjacent Au7Ag8 building
blocks are connected by an additional Ag atom, and thus, a
cluster-based, one-dimensional chain is produced.530

modes led to the configurational transformation, responsible
for the structural isomerism of this nanocluster. Furthermore,
HPLC was used to separate the two enantiomers of the chiralAu9Ag12 nanocluster, and CD signals were observed.537
6.1.2 Au/Ag alloy nanoclusters of 25-50 metal atoms

Fig. 19 Structures of Au/Ag alloy nanoclusters with metal
atom number up to 25, including (a) Au4Ag5(DPPM)2(S-Adm)6;
(b) Au6Ag2(PPh2py)6; (c) Au10Ag2(2-py-C≡C)3(PPh2py)6; (d)
Au1Ag16(S-Ph-tBu)12; (e) Au4Ag13(DPPM)3(SR)9; and (f)
Au9Ag12(SR)4(DPPM)6Br6.
Bigioni and co-workers characterized Ag17(S-Ph-tBu)12, and
DFT predicted that the homo-silver nanocluster contained an
icosahedral Ag13 kernel capped by four tetrahedrally arranged
Ag1(SR)3 staple motifs.531 In their follow-up work,
Au1Ag16(SR)12 was prepared and facilitated the determination
of the structure,532 in which the mono-Au heteroatom was
doped into the center of the icosahedral kernel (Fig. 19d). Of
note, such a center-doping mode is the same as doping a
single Au atom into Ag25(SR)18 that bears an icosahedral Ag13
kernel as well. So far, Ag17(SR)12 is the smallest homo-silver
nanocluster protected by thiolates.532
Chen et al. reported the first alloy nanocluster
(Au4Ag13(DPPM)3(SR)9) that bearing the crystallizationinduced emission enhancement (CIEE) performance.533 CIEE is
a PL variation phenomenon that a non-emissive or weakemissive compound (in solution or amorphous state) shows
high fluorescence when in crystal state.533-535 The structure of
Au4Ag13 exhibits an icosahedral Au4Ag9 kernel: one Au atom
at the center, and three Au atoms are on the icosahedral
kernel shell with triangular arrangement (Fig. 19e). Three
Ag1(DPPM)1(SR)3 units cap the Au4Ag9 kernel along the C3 axis.
Interestingly, the non-emissive Au4Ag13 (in solution and
amorphous state) exhibited high PL (QY = 2.7%) in the crystal
state owing to the inter-nanocluster C-H···π interactions.533
By exploiting the thiol-etching synthetic procedure, Jin et
al. reported three small phosphine-protected nanoclusters:
Au13(DPPM)6, Au18(DPPM)6Br4, and Au20(DPPM)6(CN)6.536
Based on Au18(DPPM)6Br4, the authors doped up to 2 Ag
heteroatoms at the position(s) linked to Br due to the
stronger binding capability of Ag-Br, and produced Au18536
xAgx(DPPM)6Br4 (x = 1, 2).
Zhu and co-workers reported Au9Ag12(SR)4(DPPM)6X6 (SR
= S-Adm or S-tBu; X = Br or Cl) nanoclusters which contained
an
icosahedral
Au5Ag8
kernel,
and
an
Au4(DPPM)4@Ag4(SR)4(DPPM)2@X6 peripheral structure (Fig.
19f).537 With different arrangements of the surface Au atoms,
a pair of structural isomers was observed in the unit cell:
chiral-Au9Ag12 and achiral-Au9Ag12. As for the chiral Au9Ag12,
the changeable Au4Ag9@Au4 kernel-surface inter-linking

In addition to Au1Ag24(SR)18 containing an Au1Ag12 kernel, Li
et al. reported another Au1Ag24 nanocluster that is coprotected by DPPM and S-c-C6H11 ligands, namely,
Au1Ag24(DPPM)3(SR)17 (Fig. 20a).538 Compared with the
standard icosahedral Au1Ag12 kernel in Au1Ag24(SR)18,
Au1Ag24(DPPM)3(SR)17 has a distorted icosahedral Au1Ag12
kernel (6 e), which is surrounded by an Ag12(DPPM)3(SR)15
ring motif, and two μ3 bridging thiolates.538

The ligand effect on the alloying process has been
investigated as well. Du et al. reported different alloying
patterns of Au/Ag-C≡C-R nanoclusters bearing different R
groups.539 Two related nanoclusters with different sizes were
synthesized by the same procedure, formulated as
Au4Ag23(C≡C-tBu)(DPPF)4Cl7
and
Au5Ag24(C≡C-C6H4-ptBu) (DPPF) Cl .539 Au Ag

kernel surrounded by an Au3Ag11 shell, which is further
capped by three types of ligands (Fig. 20b, left). As for
Au5Ag24, the icosahedral Au1Ag12 kernel is encircled by four
Ag atoms, and further protected by an Au4Ag12 shell (Fig. 20b,
right).539 The Au1@Ag12 kernels in these two nanoclusters
agree again with the alloying mode in other silver-based
nanoclusters that contain icosahedral M13 kernels.69,70

Zang and co-workers obtained crystal structures of
Ag34S2(S-Ch2Ph)18(CF3COO)9(DMF)6, which contained an
Ag13@Ag21 core-shell configuration.540 Doping this homosilver nanocluster with Au(PPh3)Cl would substitute the
central Ag atom with Au, whereas the other parts of the
parent nanocluster were retained. In other words, the doped
Au1Ag33 nanocluster showed an Au1Ag12(kernel)@Ag21(shell)
configuration.540
Guan et al. reported the syntheses and structures of
Ag34(BTCA)3(C≡CtBu)9(tfa)4(CH3OH)3
and
Au1Ag33(BTCA)3(C≡CtBu)9(tfa)4(CH3OH)3
(BTCA
=
ptertbutylthiacalixarene; tfa = trifluoroacetate).541 Both
nanoclusters contain icosahedral M13 kernels (i.e., Ag13 kernel
in Ag34 and Au1Ag12 kernel in Au1Ag33 with the Au heteroatom
at the center), and the doping Au at the center provided an
enhancement of stability to the nanocluster (Fig. 20c).541
Based on the Ag40(S-CH2Ph-tBu)22(CH3COO)10 nanocluster,
two mono-Au-doped alloy nanoclusters, Au1Ag39(S-CH2PhtBu) (CH COO)
and Au1Ag39(S-CH2Ph-tBu)20(CH3COO)12,
21

11
have been synthesized and structurally determined.542 These
three nanoclusters possess a similar metal framework, albeit
some of the thiolate ligands of Ag40 have been replaced by
the introduced acetate ligand(s) in both Au1Ag39
nanoclusters.542 The thiolate-acetate exchangeable sites are
located at the two poles of the nanocluster framework.542
Au3Ag38(S-CH2Ph)24X5 (X = Cl/Br) features a face-fused biicosahedral rod-like Au2@Au1Ag20 kernel, an Ag18(SCH2Ph)24X5 shell, and two bare X atoms (Fig. 20d).543 The biicosahedral Au3Ag20 kernel is constituted by fusing two
Au2Ag11 icosahedral units at the M3 plane, and the two
centers of both icosahedrons are occupied by Au. In addition,
the Ag18(S-CH2Ph)24X5 shell is formed by aggregating two
Ag6(SR)6 units from two poles and one Ag6(SR)2X3 unit at the
equator.543
Wang et al. reported 2-Spy, PhC≡C, and Cl ligands coprotected Au24Ag20 with a concentric tri-stratified
arrangement: Au12(kernel)@Ag20(shell)@Au12(surface) (Fig.
20e).544 On the surface, two types of motif structures are
observed:
Ag5(shell)@Au1(PhC≡C)2(surface)
and
Ag5(shell)@Au1(PhC≡C)1(Spy)1(surface). The peripheral PhC≡C
ligands were labile and thus, easy to be removed upon
thermal treatments or be exchanged by other types of
ligands; of note, in the ligand exchange processes, the
metallic part was retained, rendering new derivatives with
the same metallic configuration but different surface
functionality.544
A 45-atom trigonal-prismatic Au/Ag nanocluster is
reported by Huang et al., formulated as Au9Ag36(SPhCl2)27(PPh3)6, which follows an Au(kernel)@Ag(shell)
configuration; in other words, the Au atoms make up a
trigonal prismatic Au9 kernel (Fig. 20f).545 The Ag surface is
comprised of a tricapped trigonal prismatic Ag30(SR)27 and six
Ag-PPh3 terminals. The distorted square face containing 13
Ag atoms is similar to a “FCC” structure, and within this FCC
plane, all edges are bridged by thiol ligands except for three
Ag-Ag edges; that is, three vacancies are generated. Two
reasons are proposed to explain these “vacancies”: (i) the

steric hindrance of the peripheral thiolate ligands; (ii) the
superatom electronic shell closing of 1S21P61D10.545
The Au26Ag22(S-Ph-tBu)30 nanocluster displays a
Au12(kernel)@Au1Ag19(1st
shell)@Au13(SR)26(2nd
shell)@Ag3(SR)4(surface)
configuration.546
The
overall
structure of Au26Ag22 exhibits a basket-like construction with
a handle-like Ag3(SR)4 motif, and the Au13(SR)26 shell is
comprised of 13 Au1(SR)2 monomeric staple motifs. The free
valence electron of Au26Ag22 is 18e (26 + 22 - 30), following
the closed-shell electronic structure.546
Ligand-protected nanoclusters bearing closed electronic
shells have been considered as superatoms due to their
noble-gas-atom-like valence electron configurations. Several
nanoclusters with icosahedral kernels possess 8 free valence
electrons,
such
as
[Au13(PPh3)10Cl2]3+,
[Au25(SR)18]-,
[Ag25(SR)18] , and so on. Jin et al. reported two alloy
nanoclusters bearing a dimer of 8-electron superatom
units―Au2Ag42(S-Adm)27 and Au2Ag48(S-tBu)20(DPPM)6Br11
(Fig. 20g).547 Both nanoclusters show two independent
icosahedral Au1Ag12 kernels binding to each other. Specifically,
Au2Ag42 contains two Au1Ag12 icosahedrons wrapped by an
Ag18(S-Adm)27 shell consisting of three independent Ag6(SAdm)9 motifs; as for Au2Ag48, the two independent Au1Ag12
icosahedrons are central-enwrapped by five Br atoms, and
each Au1Ag12 unit is also capped by an Ag12(StBu) (DPPM) Br integrate motif structure as well.547 The free
10
3 3
electron count of each nanocluster is 16, which doubles that
of the single icosahedron. DFT calculations suggested that
these icosahedral units (Au1Ag12) still retained the superatom
feature
after
the
superatom-superatom
assembly.
Consequently, the electronic structures of both Au2Ag42 and
Au2Ag48 could be interpreted in terms of the dimerization of
two 8-electron superatoms.547
6.1.3 Au/Ag alloy nanoclusters of more than 50 metal atoms
Wang et al. reported all-alkynyl-capped intermetallic Au34Ag28
nanocluster stabilized by 34 PhC≡C ligands.548 The structure
of Au34Ag28 follows a four-concentric configuration:
Ag1(center)@Au17(1st-shell)@Ag17(2nd-shell)@Au17(motif) (Fig.
21a). The Au17 is stabilized by PhC≡C ligands, forming AgPhC≡C-Au-PhC≡C-Ag
motifs.
Similar
to
the
Au24Ag20(SPy)4(PhC≡C)20Cl2 alloy nanocluster, the PhC≡C
ligands could be easily removed upon thermal
treatments.544,548 Thus, the catalytic activity of Au34Ag28 with
or without ligands for hydrolytic oxidation of organosilanes to
silanols were compared. Interestingly, it was observed for the
first time that the nanoclusters with whole ligands were
much higher in catalysis than those with surface ligands
partially or completely removed.548
To investigate the function of different metals in specific
positions, a series of correlated nanoclusters (e.g., homo-gold,
homo-silver, and Au/Ag alloy nanoclusters with abundant
configurations) should be prepared and compared. Zhu and
co-workers obtained Au24Ag46(SR)32 and compared its
catalytic performance with Au25(SR)18, Ag44(SR)30, and
Au12Ag32(SR)30.549 The Au24Ag46 alloy nanocluster shows a
multi-shell
configuration:

shell)@Ag20(2nd-shell)@Ag24Au6(SR)32(motifs) (Fig. 21b). Four
types of motifs were observed on the surface, including
Ag4(SR)1, Ag3(SR)1, Ag2Au1(SR)1, and Au1(SR)2.549 As the
integrate structure has one C3 and three C2 symmetric axes as
well as three σd planes, the point group of Au24Ag46(SR)32 is
D3d. Interestingly, in terms of the styrene oxidization, surface
Au atoms were determined to be capable of enhancing the
conversions of the catalysis, while surface Ag atoms could
enhance the selectivity of benzaldehyde.549
A large Au80Ag30(C≡CPh)42Cl9 alloy nanocluster with a
concentric four-shell Russian doll arrangement is reported as
well.550 The innermost kernel is an octahedral Au6, which is
wrapped by the Au35 shell. The Au6@Au35 is further
surrounded
by
two
more
shells,
forming
the
Au6@Au35@Ag30Au18@Au21 metal configuration (Fig. 21c). A
total of 42 -C≡C-Ph and 9 μ2-Cl ligands are clamping on the
nanocluster surface, and three types of staple motifs,
including Au2Ag2@Ph-C≡C-Au-C≡C-Ph, Au2Ag3@Ph-C≡C-AuC≡C-Ph, and Au1Ag4@Ph-C≡C-Au-C≡C-Ph, are found. In a
control experiment that no halide sources were added, only
some small-sized nanoclusters could be detected, which
proved the critical effect of chloride in the preparation of this
large-sized alloy nanocluster. The point group of Au80Ag30 is
D3d (one C3 symmetric axis, three C2 symmetric axes, and
three σd symmetric planes).550 In their follow-up works, by
changing the Ag precursors in the synthetic procedure of
Au80Ag30,
another
large-sized
Au57Ag53(C≡CPh)40Br12
nanocluster with different metal and ligand compositions was
obtained.551 Although the metal atom numbers in these two
nanoclusters are the same, the metal arrangement of
Au57Ag53 exhibits an Au3Ag2@Au34@Ag51@Au20 architecture.
As the surface motifs in Au57Ag53 are much more complicated,
the nanocluster displays an irregular structure with C1
symmetry (Fig. 21d).551
The synthesis and the structure of Au130-xAgx(SR)55 (x ~ 98;
SR = SPhtBu) have been reported.552 The overall structure of
Au130-xAgx comprises a decahedral M54 (M = Au/Ag) core. In
this regular M54 decahedron, all of the ~32 Au atoms are
localized in the truncated M49 Marks decahedron, whereas
the five corners of the M54 decahedron comprise 100% Ag
atoms. The truncated M49 Marks decahedron contains an Agrich Au5.8Ag11.2 tetrahedral core that is capped by an Au-rich
Au26.8Ag5.2 hollow cage. The obtained M49 decahedron is
further capped by a shell of Ag65 with overall D5h symmetry
and 16 outermost Ag. In this context, the overall structure of
Au130-xAgx(SR)55 follows an (AuAg)49@Ag81(SR)55 core-shell
configuration.552

In 2018, Yan et al. reported Ag267-xAux(SR)80 (x ~93.8),
which is the largest alloy nanocluster to date.553 Owing to its
large size, Ag267-xAux displays metallic behavior (e.g. plasmon
excitation). It contains a concentric icosahedral structure ―
Ag1(center)@M12(1st-shell)@M42(2nd-shell)@M92(3rdshell)@Ag120(SR)80(cage) (M = Au or Ag, see Fig. 21e). Of note,
the Ag1@M12@M42@M92 kernel is a M147 icosahedron, which
is similar to the kernel in the Pd165-xPtx(CO)72(PPh3)20
nanocluster.554 In addition, a regular triangle-tetragonpentagon interlaced arrangement is observed on the surface.
The surface Ag atoms are anchored with thiolates via two
modes, i.e. Ag3 triangle@SR and Ag4 tetragon@SR.553 Of note,

in the unit cell, another medium-sized Au9Ag36(SR)27(PPh3)6 is
observed (Fig. 21f), of which the structure is similar to that of
previously reported Au9Ag36, albeit with some difference in
peripheral ligands.545,553 Compared with Ag267-xAux(SR)80,
Au9Ag36 has an 18-electron shell closing, a notable HOMOLUMO energy gap, and molecule-like optical absorption. Such
a co-crystallization is meaningful (Fig. 21g), and the
interactions between the methyl group on Ag267-xAux(SR)80
and the benzene ring of PPh3 ligands o Au9Ag36(SR)27(PPh3)6
are proposed to play a predominant role in the nanocluster
assembly in crystals.553
6.2 Au/Cu alloy nanoclusters
Introduing heterometals into the nanocluster is of
importance to prepare new nanoclusters with novel
structures and intriguing properties. For example, comparing
the M-SR bonding modes between Au25(SR)18 and Ag25(SR)18,
the Au-SR bonding in Au25(SR)18 is a linear type for Au2(SR)3
motifs, whereas the μ3-Ag (one Ag binds to three thiolates) is
observed in Ag25(SR)18. One may wonder what binding mode
of Cu-ligand will be, similar or different with those of Auligand or Ag-ligand binding? Consequently, Au/Cu and Ag/Cu
alloy nanoclusters would hopefully show novel structures
comparing to homo-Au, homo-Ag, and bi-metallic Au/Ag
nanoclusters. In the following two sections, selective Au/Cu
and Ag/Cu nanoclusters with specific structures are reviewed
(and also see Table 8 for a summary of Au/Cu alloy
nanoclusters), as a supplement to sections 4.2 and 4.3.

By exploiting the aggregation-induced emission (AIE)
concept, non-luminescent Cu(I)-SR complexes are selfassembled by Au(0) to produce highly luminescent
Au2Cu6(SR)6(PPh3)2
nanocluster (Fig. 22a).555,556 Au2Cu6
contains two free electrons and is indeed the smallest Au/Cu
nanocluster. Structurally, a total of six Cu(I)-SR complexes are
assembled into a hexagon with two gold atoms, and these
two Au(0) are further stabilized by PPh3 ligands. One C3, three
C2 axes, three mirror planes (σd), and one symmetric center
(i) can be found in the nanocluster, giving D3d symmetry.555,556
Using DPPM instead of PPh3 in the synthesis could give rise to
Au4Cu4(SR)5(DPPM)2 (Fig. 22b), which comprises an Au4P4
kernel, and a perpendicular Cu4(SR)5 ring.557 Significantly,
there are four isomers in the crystal lattice of Au4Cu4.557
By reducing the Au/Cu-SR-PPh2py complexes (SR = SPhtBu) with NaBH4, Song et al. obtained an alloyed
Au7Cu12(PPh2py)6(SR)6Br4 nanocluster (Fig. 22c), containing a
ring-like Au7Cu6 kernel in the middle, and two “hat-like” Cu3based motifs with four Br atoms from top and bottom.558

Chai et al. synthesized and structurally determined a 30nuclei Au/Cu bi-metallic Au24Cu6(SPhtBu)22 (Fig. 22e).561 Six
copper atoms are found to exclusively occupy the surface
shoulder sites to form two planar Cu3(SR)3 motifs reminiscent
of benzene rings on each side. Indeed, the π conjugation
within this planar motif plays a pivotal role in catalyzing the
ring-opening reaction.561

—
Au19Cu30(C≡CR)22(Ph3P)6Cl2 (Fig. 22f) was reported by the
Wang group in 2017.562 Alkynyl ligands are arranged on the
surface, mainly protecting the exposed Cu atoms, and the
Au19Cu30
shows
a
multi-shell
structure
as
Au1@Au12@Cu30@Au6. The outermost six Au atoms
constitute a chair-like hexagonal configuration, which is
further stabilized by the PPh3 ligands. Moreover, interfacial
structure between Cu and alkynyl ligands follows the μ3
bridging modes, which is distinctly different from those in Aualkynyl and Au/Ag-alkynyl nanoclusters.562
6.3 Ag/Cu alloy nanoclusters
Early in 2011, Williams and co-workers reported the synthesis
of Cl@Ag14 cluster compound (all metals are with +1 charge
state) and its Cu-doped Cl@Ag14-xCux (x up to six)
counterparts. A reversible process between Cl@Ag14 and
Cl@Ag14-xCux could be expressed as Cl@Ag14 + x Cu+ →
Cl@CuxAg14-x + x Ag+ and Cl@CuxAg14-x + x Ag+ → Cl@Ag14 + x
Cu+.563 The crystal structure of Cl@Cu6Ag8 was determined
two years later,564 in which the metallic kernel featured a
rhombic dodecahedron (Fig. 22g).
[Ag20Cu12(SR)14(DPPM)6Br8]2+ (where SR = S-Adm) is
reported by Zou et al., which consists an Ag17 kernel capped
by an Ag3Cu12(SR)14(DPPM)6Br8 cage (Fig. 22h).565 The cage is
assembled by two Ag1Cu6(SR)7(DPPM)3Br4 via an Ag atom,
and each Ag1Cu6(SR)7(DPPM)3Br4 is composed of a
Cu2(SR)3(DPPM)Br and an Ag1Cu3(SR)4(DPPM)2Br3 linked by a
Cu atom. Similar to Ag28Cu12, all Cu atoms are selectively
incorporated on the surface. By comparing the structures of
Ag20Cu12, Ag32(DPPE)5(SR)24 and Ag32(DPPM)5(S-Adm)13Cl8, the
authors investigated the ligand and metal effects on the
structures of nanoclusters.565-567
By using multiple types of protected ligands including
bare S atom, tert-butyl thiolate, and tert-butyl sulfonate,
Yang et al. obtained Ag40.13Cu13.87S19(tBuS)20(tBuSO3)12 which
exhibited
a
Cu10Ag2S7
kernel
capped
by
a
M42(tBuS)20(tBuSO3)12 (M42 contained 3.87 Cu and 38.13 Ag
atoms) cage and twelve bare S atoms (Fig. 22i).568 There are
several symmetric elements based on the structure of
(AgCu)54, demonstrating the high symmetry of this alloy
nanocluster.568
In conclusion, several Au/Cu and Ag/Cu alloy nanoclusters
have been reported, reflecting different metal arrangements
and metal-ligand interface structures, and structuredetermined properties compared to the homo-gold, homosilver, and bi-metallic Au/Ag nanoclusters. However,
compared with Au/Ag alloy nanoclusters that have been

extensively investigated, the research on Au/Cu is less, and
Ag/Cu is even less. Future work may pay more attention to
such alloys.
6.4 Alloy nanoclusters with other metals (Pd/Pt/Cd)
In addition to the alloy nanoclusters composed of Au/Ag/Cu
(elements of group 11), other metals from 10 and 12 groups,
e.g. Pd/Pt/Cd, can be alloyed with these 11 group elements
as well, forming new structures based on different alloying
modes. In this section, we highlight some literature works,
with a focus on the similarities and differences in structures
and other characteristics.
Yang et al. obtained the crystal structures Cd1Au14(SR)12
(SR = StBu) and predicted the structure of Au15(SR)12- and
Au15(SR)13 nanoclusters by DFT calculation.569 So far, the
structure of this small Au-SR nanocluster—Au15(SR)13 with 2electron—is still not accessible.570-573 As for Cd1Au14, its
Cd1Au5 kernel, which is constituted by combining two Cd1Au3
tetrahedrons at the Cd-Au edge, is capped by two Au4(SR)5
tetrameric staple motifs and one Au1(SR)2 monomeric staple
motif (Fig. 23b).569

By reacting poly-hydrido copper clusters Cu28H15(dtc)12 or
Cu20H11(dtp)9 with phenyl acetylene in the presence of
Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, Chakrahari et al. obtained two Cu-rich bimetallic nanoclusters—Pd1Cu14H2(dtc/dtp)6(C≡CPh)6 (dtc =
S2CNnBu2; dtp = S2P(OiPr)2).574 SC-XRD demonstrated that the
introduced Pd heteroatom was at the center of the Pd1H2Cu14
kernel in both nanoclusters, displaying the highest
coordination number (14) so far recorded (Fig. 23c). Each H
atom in the nanocluster was connected to one Pd0 and four
CuI atoms in a slightly distorted trigonal bipyramidal
geometry.574
Alloying the Au34(SR)22 nanocluster (SR = S-c-C6H11) with
Cd(NO3)2 produces Au26Cd4(SR)22, which comprises a
distorted FCC Au16 kernel capped by two “paw-like” Cd1(SRAu-SR)3 motifs, one pentameric Au3Cd2(SR)8 motif and one
monomeric Au1(SR)2 motif (Fig. 23d).575 Owing to the
presence of Cd heteroatoms, one monomeric Au1(SR)2 motif
and one trimeric Au3(SR)4 motif merge into a new pentameric

Au3Cd2(SR)8 motif.575 A dealloying process was observed in
Au26Cd4(SR)22 ― the addition of Au(I)-SR induced a reversible
process and Au26Cd4(SR)22 transformed back to the parent
Au34(SR)22 nanocluster, while Au18(SR)14 was obtained in the
presence of Pd(II)-(SR)2.575
By changing the feeding Pt/Ag procedures in the synthesis
of Pt5Ag22, Shen and Mizuta obtained Pt1Ag42(C≡C-C6H4CH3)28
nanocluster (8e), containing an icosahedral Pt1Ag12 kernel
and an Ag30(C≡CR)28 shell (Fig. 23e).576 Such a Pt1Ag12 kernel is
the same as that in other Pt-alloyed Ag nanoclusters, such as
Pt1Ag24(SR)18, Pt1Ag28(S2R)12(PPh3)4, and Pt2Ag23(PPh3)10Cl7.
Among the 28 alkynyl ligands, 12 of them are not only linked
to the Ag on the shell but also bonded to Ag on the
icosahedron. In addition, SC-XRD also demonstrated the
interactions between SbF6- ions and Ag atoms on the kernel
shell (via Ag-F bonds), representing a unique penetrability of
the Ag30 shell. All these unique interactions result in the high
stability of this Pt/Ag alloy nanocluster.576
Early in 2007, a large Pt/Pd alloy nanocluster co-protected
by CO and PPh3 ligands was reported, formulated as Pd165554 The innermost kernel is an
xPtx(CO)72(PPh3)20 (x ~8).
icosahedral μ12-Pt@Pd12-xPtx (x ~1.2), which is wrapped by an
icosahedral Pd42-xPtx (x ~3.5) shell, and then a 60-atom semiregular icosahedral Pd60-xPtx shell (x ~2.2) (Fig. 23f). The
outermost part is a dodecahedral Pd50 cage with 20 PPh3
ligands attached onto it, and the CO ligands bonding to Pd60554 Of note, except
xPtx and Pd50 are symmetrically arranged.
for the M165 nanocluster, several other alloy nanoclusters costabilized by phosphine and C-based ligands have been
reported, including Au4Pd32(CO)28(PMe3)14 and Cu43Al577,578 Thus, the combination of C-based and
12(C5Me5)12.
phosphine ligands may generate new alloy nanoclusters that
exhibit novel structures and compositions compared with
those protected by thiolate ligands.
6.5 Alloy nanoclusters with predicted structures
The aforementioned alloy nanoclusters exhibit explicit
atomically precise structures. Besides, there are some more
alloy nanoclusters without solved structures, albeit their
structures are proposed by DFT calculations. Sarkar et al.
identified [Ag5Pd4(Se-Ph)12]- by ESI-MS and MS-MS
measurements.579 Based on the previously reported Ag7 and
Ag8 clusters, Pradeep and co-workers added Au into the
solution of such homo-silver clusters and obtained a 13-atom
Au6Ag7 cluster according to ESI-MS analysis.580,581 Hasegawa
et al. reported the poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (PVP)
stabilized homo-gold Au nanoclusters and alloyed them with
Pd or Rh heteroatoms, such as Au43Pd1, Au33Pd1, Au19Pd1, and
Au34Rh1, which all displayed enhanced catalytic activities
relative to homo-gold nanoclusters.582,583
In 2019, Aikens and co-workers investigated the optimal
structures of mono-doped M1Au24, M1Ag24 and M1Au37 (M =
Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag/Au, Zn, Cd, Hg, Ga, In and Tl)
nanoclusters.584 For all clusters, the group 10 dopants (Ni, Pd,
and Pt) prefer to occupy the center due to the relative
stability of d electrons in these dopants. For dopants from

groups 11-13, doping on the kernel shell or in the staple
motifs becomes thermodynamically more preferable as a
result of symmetry-dictated coupling between dopant atomic
orbitals and super-atomic levels as well as because of the
relativistic contraction of s and p orbitals.584 These
calculations indicate that alloy nanoclusters have higher
stability and intriguing chemical/physical properties, which
might guide the experimental syntheses of alloy nanoclusters
with enhanced performances.
6.6 Alloying on phosphine-stabilized cluster compounds
with hyper-coordinated carbon
Most of the alloy nanoclusters summarized above contain
free electrons (electron count n* = N – M – z, where N is the
number metal atoms, M is the number of electron-localizing
ligands, and z is nanocluster overall charge).199 Besides, Wang
et al. reported several alloy cluster compounds based on the
C@Au6 nanoclusters ― these complexes contain no free
electrons, but are composed of metal cores and peripheral
ligands, and thus described as metal cluster compounds.585594 In this section, these cluster compounds are reviewed. Of
note, along with the coordination of such heteroatoms (Ag or
Cu), the parent (C@Au6) displays significant changes in
luminescence, which will be discussed in Section 7.1.2.
By altering the PPh3 ligands to PPh2py, a total of six N
coordination sites are introduced in C-PPh2py@Au6 template,
and consequently, the introduced Ag+ ions will bond to the
surface, generating C-PPh2py@Au6Ag2 (Fig. 24, upperright).586 Due to the high emission, C-PPh2py@Au6Ag2 has
been used to light up the nucleolus of living cells (see Section
8.3 for more details).587-589 Wang and co-workers further
introduced aldehydes or carboxyls into the ligands of
C@Au6Ag2, and obtained several new C-Au6Ag2 with different
surface structures.590,591 Besides, adding CuI salts into the
solution of C-PPh2py@Au6 produces C-PPh2py@Au6Cu2 alloy,
and the coordination situation of Cu is the same as that of Ag
in Au6Ag2 (i.e., each Cu links to three N atoms on ligands and
three Au atoms; see Fig. 24, bottom-right).592
Lei et al. assembled these nanoclusters via intraconnection mode into cluster-based MOFs.593 By using mdppz
ligand (2-(3-methylpyrazinyl)-diphenylphosphine) in place of
PPh2py in C-PPh2py@Au6Ag2, C-mdppz@Au6Ag6 emerged. Of
note, each mdppz ligand contains two N donors: one inward
and one outward. As for C-mdppz@Au6Ag6, the inward N
donors are employed by the two Ag heteroatoms, whereas
the outward N donors are “free” (Fig. 24, upper-left).593 In the
follow-up work, Lei et al. introduced more inward N donors
on the phosphine ligand by altering PPh2py into PPhpy2, and
then anchored more Ag heteroatoms on the nanocluster
surface.594 By stepwise anchoring Ag heteroatoms on the CPPhpy2@Au6
surface,
C-PPhpy2@Au6Ag4
and
CPPhpy2@Au6Ag6 alloy cluster compounds were generated.594
SC-XRD demonstrated that the surface structure of
PPhpy2@Au6Ag6 was extremely compact, indicating the high
rigidity of this nanocluster, and the rigidity further resulted in
the strong PL of PPhpy2@Au6Ag6 (PL QY of 92%).594

7 Properties of Alloy Nanoclusters
Compared with nanoparticles of large sizes, metal
nanoclusters display several glamorous characteristics:
atomically precise structures, quantum size effects, and
discrete electronic states. The first characteristic enables us
to grasp the structural evolution from metal complexes to
plasmonic metal nanoparticles. The latter two characteristics
endow the nanoclusters with size- or structure-dependent
properties. The combination of the these characteristics
pinpoint the precise correlations between the structures and
properties of nanoclusters, which are of great significance not
only because they can help us to figure out the
mechanisms/originates of the intriguing properties, but can
also be served as guidelines in customizing the nanoclusters
(or other nanomaterials) with desired performances. Alloying
has been served as a versatile method in tailoring the
chemical and physical properties of nanoclusters. Based on
the atomically precise structures of these alloy nanoclusters,

several efforts have been made to figure out the alloying
effects (so-called synergistic effects) on the properties of
nanoclusters. In this section, the reported alloying-induced
property variations are classified into five aspects, including
absorptions
and
(i)
optical
properties
(optical
photoluminescence), (ii) electrochemical properties, (iii)
electroluminescence properties, (iv) magnetic properties, (v)
chiral properties, and (vi) stability and reactivity. Of note, the
catalytic properties and the corresponding works will be
reviewed in Section 8.1 (applications of alloy nanoclusters).
7.1 Optical properties
The structure and composition of nanoclusters are decisive to
their physical/chemical properties. The optical properties are
the most studied due to their significance in applications such
as chemical sensing and biological imaging. Alloying alters the
metal composition of nanoclusters, and may further affect
their geometric/electronic structures, as reflected in the
different optical properties. In this section, the alloying
effects on the optical properties are reviewed.

7.1.1 Optical absorption
The absorption spectrum of Au18(S-C6H11)14 shows three
bands at 445, 570, and 630 nm, whereas that of doped
Au15Ag3(S-C6H11)14 centers at 400, 505, and 545 nm (Fig. 25a,
left).267 As for S-PhMe2 capped Au18 nanocluster, Ag-doping
also blue-shifts the absorption peak from 625 nm of Au18(SPhMe2)14 to 566 nm of Au15Ag3(S-PhMe2)14 (Fig. 25a,
right).256 These blue-shifts illustrate that the incorporation
of Ag heteroatoms can interfere with the electronic
structure and affect the overall optical absorption of
Au18(SR)14 nanoclusters.256,267 Based on the precise system,
the correlations between structure and properties are
investigated.256,267 Optically, the remarkable blue-shifts (cal.
70 nm in HS-C6H11 stabilized system, and 60 nm in HSPhMe2 stabilized system) are observed,256,267 and

accompanied by Ag doping, the HOMO-LUMO gap of Au18
nanoclusters significantly decreases.
Similar to M18(SR)14, Ag-alloying induced structure
transformation is responsible for the energy gap (Eg)
enlargement in Ag1Au20(SR)15 (1.60 eV at room temperature
and 1.96 eV at 80 K) compared to Au21(SR)15 (1.70 eV at
room temperature and 2.08 eV at 80 K).279 As for the Au23xAgx(SR)15 nanoclusters, Eg continues to increase with
higher Ag-doping extent (Fig. 25b): at room temperature,
the 1.31 eV Eg of Au19Ag4(SR)15 increases to 1.37 eV of Au23xAgx(SR)15 (avg. x = 5.76), then to 1.46 eV of Au23-xAgx(SR)15
(avg. x = 7.44); while at 80 K, the 1.45 eV Eg of Au19Ag4(SR)15
increases to 1.50 eV of Au23-xAgx(SR)15 (avg. x = 5.76), then
to 1.54 eV of Au23-xAgx(SR)15 (avg. x = 7.44).279

Xie and co-workers controlled the Ag-doping extent
based on the Au25(MHA)18 nanocluster and systematically
studied the doping effects on optical absorption.182 The
slightly-doped Au25-xAgx(MHA)18 (x = 0-2) shows four
distinct absorption peaks at 440, 552, 670, and 760 nm (Fig.
26a); further Ag-doping induces the blue-shifts and
disappearance of these peaks, and a gradually increased
peak at 470 nm; finally, the 470 nm peak evolves into the
most obvious peak when 7-11 Ag heteroatoms are doped
into the template (Fig. 26a). The optical evolution is also
reflected in the changes in solution colors of these
nanoclusters (insets of Fig. 26a).182
Doping different heteroatoms into the Au25(SR)18
template influences the optical absorption in different
ways.174,211,522 Wang et al. compared the optical absorption
of Au25(S-C2H4Ph)18 and its Ag-, Cu-, Cd-, and Hg-doped
derivatives.174 As shown in Fig. 26b, Au25(S-C2H4Ph)18 shows
absorption at 400, 450, 670, and 780 nm; while Ag-doping

blue-shifts the 400 and 670 nm peaks to 380 and 615 nm,
respectively, and the peak at 780 nm fades away. Cudoping red-shifts the initial 670 nm peak to 690 nm and
eliminates the peak at 780 nm. Mono-Cd doping
(Au24Cd1(S-C2H4Ph)18) blue-shifts the 670 and 780 nm peaks
of Au25 to 650 and 770 nm, respectively. As for Au24Hg1(SC2H4Ph)18, two main peaks are observed at 405 and 710 nm
(Fig. 26b).174
Lee and co-workers analyze the Pd- and Pt-doping
effects on optical absorption: in the low energy region (<
2.5 eV), Au25 shows an intense absorption band at 1.80 eV,
while upon Pd doping, the 1.80 eV band becomes weak, but
other two intense bands (1.2 and 2.0 eV) emerge.211 As for
Pt1Au24(S-C2H4Ph)18, two absorption peaks are observed at
1.1 and 2.1 eV (Fig. 26c).211 The large difference in optical
gaps (~0.3 eV for Pt/Pd doped M1Au24 vs. ~1.3 eV for Au25)
is associated with the change in superatomic configuration,
i.e. 1S21P4 for Pt/Pd doped M1Au24 vs. 1S21P6 for Au25.211

Based on the Au25(SR)18 template, Wu et al. reported the
stepwise doping process from mono-metallic Au25(SR)18 to
bi-metallic Au25-xAgx(SR)18 and Au24Hg1(SR)18, then to trimetallic Au24-xAgxHg1(SR)18, and the evolution of optical
absorption was studied.521 The Ag- and Hg-doping effects
are similar to those summarized in Fig. 26b, whereas the
tri-metallic Au24-xAgxHg1(SR)18 nanoclusters show two
intense peaks at 435 and 530 nm, and two shoulder bands
at 350 and 580 nm (Fig. 26d).521
Rod-like Au25(PPh3)10(SR)5Cl2 shows several absorption
bands at 380, 415, 430, and 670 nm.349 When the template
is doped to Au25-xAgx(PPh3)10(SR)5Cl2 (x = 1-12), the peaks in
low wavelength range (< 500 nm) become flat, and the
initial 670 nm peak blue-shifts to 663 nm. By comparison,
when the doping number is even higher, i.e. x = 1-13, the
670 nm peak in Au25 significantly blue-shifts to 635 nm,
whereas the other peaks are almost unchanged (Fig.
27a).369,370 TDDFT analysis shows that increasing Ag doping
will shift the lowest-energy excited states to higher energy,

and for Au12Ag13, the transitions have a significant (>70%)
HOMO to LUMO (localized on the central atom)
contribution, different from other Au25-xAgx species.369
Au38(S-C2H4Ph)24 displays distinct bands at 1050, 750,
630, 478 nm and shoulder bands at 517 and 400 nm.232
Upon the Ag-doping, the bands at 750 and 1050 nm fade
away, and other bands gradually blue-shift and become
broad (Fig. 27b).250 It is suggested that the optical
broadening originates from the mixed-characteristics of
these doped nanoclusters (for example, the heavily-doped
Au38-xAgx nanoclusters contain Au28Ag10, Au29Ag9, Au30Ag8,
and Au31Ag7).250 Cu-doping on Au38(SR)24 blue-shifts the
initial 1050 nm peak to 1000 nm, and red-shifts the initial
750 nm peak to 790 nm.255 The Pd- and Pt-doping effects
on optical absorption of Au38(SR)24 are also investigated.262
As shown in Fig. 27c, although the peaks observed at 1.2
and 2.0 eV for Pd2Au36(SR)24 are almost the same as those
in Au38(SR)24 except for less intenseness, the absorption
spectrum of Pt2Au36(SR) shows higher energy peaks at 1.5
and 2.2 eV.262

Based on M1Ag24(SR)18 (M = Ag/Au/Pd/Pt) nanosystem,
the
alloying
effects
on
optical
absorption
are
evaluated.378,437,440,441 As shown in Fig. 28a, Ag25(SR)18 shows
four intense absorption peaks at 334, 390, 490, and 678 nm.
Substituting the central Ag atom with Pd hardly changes
these bands, which might be due to the same period of Ag
and Pd in Ag25.69,441 Doping a single Au heteroatom into
Ag25(SR)18 blue-shifts the bands of Ag25(SR)18 to 325, 375, 467,
and 625 nm, respectively, and upon Pt doping, the absorption
bands of Ag25(SR)18 are blue-shifted to 333, 390, 455, and 600
nm, respectively (Fig. 28a). The absorption spectra of
Au1Ag24(SR)18 and Pt1Ag24(SR)18 are similar, for that Au and Pt
are in the same period.441 Based on the bi-metallic

Pt1Ag24(SR)18, two tri-metallic nanoclusters―spherical
Pt1Ag24-xAux(SR)18 and rod-like Pt2Au10Ag13(PPh3)10Br7―are
synthesized, and their optical absorption spectra are
compared (Fig. 28b).378 The optical energy gap of Ag25(SR)18
(1.57 eV) increases to 1.72 eV upon Pt-doping. A further
shape-maintained, Au-alloying process on bi-metallic
Pt1Ag24(SR)18 generates tri-metallic Pt1Ag24-xAux(SR)18 which
shows a slightly reduced optical energy gap (1.62 eV).378 By
comparison, a shape-transformed, Au-alloying process
generates rod-like, tri-metallic Pt2Au10Ag13(PPh3)10Br7, which
exhibits a remarkably enlarged energy gap (1.93 eV).378

were shifted upon doping by gas-phase photoelectron
spectroscopy (PES).595 The PE spectrum of [Au1Ag24(SR)18]was similar to that of [Ag25(SR)18]-, whereas those of
[Pt1/Pd1Ag24(SR)18]2- were shifted by about 1.4 eV toward
lower binding energy relative to that of [Ag25(SR)18]-, without
any large change in spectral profiles. These PES results
together with the DFT calculations demonstrated that the
superatomic orbitals in (X@Ag12)5+ (X = Ag, Au) kernels shifted
to higher energy by replacing the central X atom by Pt or Pd
heteroatom.595 Such an upward shift of superatomic orbitals
resulted from (i) the weaker binding of valence electrons in
(Y@Ag12)4+ (Y = Pd, Pt) relative to those in (X@Ag12)5+ (X = Ag,
Au) because of the reduction in formal charge of the kernel
potential, and (ii) the upward shift of the apparent vacuum
level by the presence of a repulsive Coulomb barrier for
(Y@Ag12)4+.595
The hydrophilic Ag29(DHLA)12 nanocluster shows three
shoulder bands at 335, 430, and 500 nm.474 Slight Au-doping
blue-shifts these bands to 320, 400, and 485 nm, respectively,
and the 400 nm peak becomes intense (Fig. 29a). Further Audoping will not alter the positions of these absorption peaks,
but make them flattened (Fig. 29a).474 The doping effects on
optical absorption have also been investigated on the basis of
hydrophobic
Ag29(S2R)12(PPh3)4
and
its
Au-doped
nanoclusters.70 Ag29(S2R)12(PPh3)4 shows an intense band at
447 nm and a shoulder at 510nm, while Ag29xAux(S2R)12(PPh3)4 nanoclusters only have one intense peak at
435 nm. In addition, this peak broadens with the increasing
amount of Au dopant (Fig. 29b).70
Based on M29(S-Adm)18(PPh3)4 nanoclusters with a tetrastratified
configuration
of
M1(center)@M12(1stnd
shell)@M12(SR)18(2 -shell)@(M-PPh3)4(vertex), the structureoptical property correlations have been mapped out:448 (i) as
for the central position (Ag/Au/Pd/Pt), substituting the Ag
center by Pd heteroatom can hardly change the optical
absorption, while doping mono Pt/Au into the kernel
remarkably red-shifts the peak; (ii) as for the 2nd shell (Ag/Cu),
exchanging the Ag12(SR)18 shell to Cu12(SR)18 blue-shifts the
optical absorption while maintaining the overall profiles; (iii)
as for the vertex positions (Ag/Cu/Au), the characteristic
absorption profiles are almost retained when the vertex Ag
atoms are substituted by Cu; by contrast, metal-exchanging
these vertex atoms by Au not only red-shifts the initial
absorption, but generates a new peak at higher wavelength
as well.448
The optical absorption of Ag44(SR)30 (SR = SPhF2, SPhF, or
SPhCF3) displays six peaks at 374, 411, 483, 535, 641 and 833
nm and two shoulders at 590 and 689 nm (Fig. 29c, left).477
Upon Au-doping, the obtained Au12Ag32(SR)30 only displays
two apparent peaks at 390 and 500 nm and a shoulder at 750
nm (Fig. 29c, right). Considering that these Au heteroatoms
are all incorporated into the icosahedral kernel of Ag44(SR)30,
Yang et al. suggested a significant contribution of the kernel
metal atoms on the overall optical absorption of these
M12@Ag32(SR)30 nanoclusters.477
The UV-vis spectrum of Cu13(S2CNnBu2)6(C≡CR)4 shows
broad multi-optical absorption bands at 337, 513, 540, 571

nm and an intense one at 287 nm; by comparison, the doped
derivative, Ag1Cu12, shows optical absorption at 276, 348 and
580 nm peaks, while Au1Cu12 shows optical absorption at 310,
508 and 561 nm.518 Consequently, Cu13 solution is pink,
whereas the solutions of Ag1Cu12 and Au1Cu12 nanoclusters
are violet and orange, respectively.518

Next, we summarize the heteroatom effects on PL
characteristics. Rod-shaped Au25(PPh3)10(SR)5Cl2 possesses a
low PL intensity (QY = 0.1%), however, as shown in Fig. 30a,
substituting some Au atoms with Ag can drastically enhance
the PL intensity. The obtained Au25-xAgx (x = 1-13)
nanoclusters exhibit high PL intensity of QY = 40%, which is in
striking contrast to the weakly emissive Au25-xAgx (x = 1-12,
QY = 0.2%).368 Further theoretical works suggest that the
origin of PL enhancement lies in the nature of the first excited
state (S1) and the corresponding HOMO-LUMO transition,
which are significantly affected by the doping extents of
Ag.369 Ultrafast relaxation dynamics of Au25 and Au25-xAgx
demonstrate the importance of the vertex Ag heteroatom in
stabilizing the charges on LUMO and enhancing the rigidity of
Au25-xAgx nanoclusters, which further leads to the stronger
PL.370

The alloying effects on PL characteristics is also
investigated based on a continuous doping process from
mono-metallic Ag25(SR)18, to bi-metallic Pt1Ag24(SR)18, then to
tri-metallic
Pt1Ag24-xAux(SR)18
(x
=
6.4)
and
Pt2Au10Ag13(PPh3)10Br7 nanoclusters.378 Ag25(SR)18 displays
neglectable PL (centered at 809 nm), and Pt1Ag24(SR)18 shows
an enhanced PL (QY = 0.1%) at 728 nm (Fig. 30b). However,
further Au-alloying generates two tri-metallic nanoclusters, in
which rod-like Pt2Au10Ag13 exhibits a significantly enhanced
PL intensity at 648 nm with PL QY = 14.7%, representing a
150-fold enhancement relative to Pt1Ag24(SR)18. As a contrast,
the spherical tri-metallic Pt1AuxAg24-x(SR)18 is non-emissive
(Fig. 30b).378

Bakr and co-workers substitute the central Ag atom in
Ag25(SR)18 with Au,69 and the emission of the doped Au1Ag24
(810 nm) is blue-shifted relative to that of Ag25 (830 nm),

resulting from the modulation in the HOMO-LUMO gap after
Au-doping. Moreover, the emission intensity of Au1Ag24(SR)18
is enhanced by a factor of >25 compared to Ag25(SR)18.

Conversely, only a little change is observed by comparing the
PL characteristics between Ag25(SR)18 and Pd-doped
Pd1Ag24(SR)18 nanoclusters.69
Liu et al. investigated the PL characteristics of
M1Ag24(SR)18 nanoclusters in crystal or solution state (Fig.
30c).437 In the crystal state, the PL intensities of these
nanoclusters follow the subsequence of Pd1Ag24(SR)18 <
Ag25(SR)18 < Pt1Ag24(SR)18 < Au1Ag24(SR)18. Besides, the
emission wavelengths of Ag25(SR)18 locates at 1042 nm, while
the M-doping by Au/Pd/Pt heteroatom leads to blue-shifts in
emission by 20/21/28 nm, respectively.437 When in
acetonitrile solution, the PL intensities of these nanoclusters
follow another subsequence of Ag25(SR)18 < Pd1Ag24(SR)18 <
Au1Ag24(SR)18 < Pt1Ag24(SR)18. In addition, Ag25(SR)18,

Pd1Ag24(SR)18 and Au1Ag24(SR)18 all emit at 820 nm, whereas
Pt1Ag24(SR)18 emits at both 770 and 810 nm (Fig. 30c).437
Based on the M1Ag24(SPhMe2)18 template, Yuan et al. also
investigated the synergistic effect introduced by doping on PL
properties.439 Significantly, when the central Ag atom of
Ag25(SR)18 was exchanged by Au/Pt heteroatom, the free
electrons were concentrated toward the interior of the
nanocluster, and PL enhancement was observed.439 By
comparison, when the Ag atoms on the kernel shell of
M1Ag24(SR)18 (M = Au/Pt) was further exchanged by Au, free
valence electrons would expand to the kernel shell, resulting
in the attenuation of the PL intensity. The relationship
between the free valence electrons and PL properties
provides new insight into the origin of PL in nanoclusters.439

In the case of Ag29(S2R)12(PPh3)4, Au-doping led to a 26fold enhancement of PL; that is, the QY of Ag29 (~0.9%) was
increased to 24% when up to five Au heteroatoms were
introduced.70 Along with this PL enhancement, the emission
red-shifts from 649 nm of Ag29 to 668 nm of 40%-doped Ag29-

xAux (Fig. 31a, left). By DFT calculations, Xie et al. explored the
PL enhancement in Au-doped Ag29-xAux nanoclusters (Fig. 31a,
right), suggesting that the relativistic effects introduced by Au
heteroatoms played a significant role, especially for Au3Ag26,
Au4Ag25, and Au5Ag24 nanoclusters.467 Besides hydrophobic

Ag29, hydrophilic Ag29 also displays enhanced PL upon Audoping.467,596 However, upon Cu-doping, alloying of
Ag29(S2R)12(PPh3)4 to form Ag17Cu12(S2R)12(PPh3)4 results in a
remarkable attenuation of the PL intensity.468
All M29(S-Adm)18(PPh3)4 (M = Ag/Au/Pt/Pd/Cu) nanoclusters
fluoresce when being illuminated at 445 nm, constituting a
series of nanoclusters to analyze the structure-PL correlations
at the atomic level.448 By comparing the PL of M29(SAdm)18(PPh3)4, the synergy effects on PL characteristics in
terms of PL intensity and emission wavelength are
investigated: (i) As for the M13 kernel (M = Ag/Au/Pt/Pd),
doping Pd heteroatom into the center weakens the PL
intensity and blue-shifts the emission; on the contrary,
enhanced PL intensity as well as red-shifted emission are
observed when substituting the center-Ag with Pt or Au
atom; (ii) As for the M12(SR)18 shell (M = Ag/Cu), altering
Ag12(SR)18 into Cu12(SR)18 blue-shifts the emission wavelength
and slightly reduces the PL intensity; (iii) substituting Ag
atoms by Au in the (M-PPh3)4 vertex (M = Ag/Au/Cu), not only
red-shifts the emission, but also remarkably enhances the PL
intensity; an opposite phenomenon is observed when
replacing Ag with Cu.448 According to the above observations,

the configuration of Au1@Ag12@Ag12(SR)18@(Au-PPh3)4
displays the highest PL intensity and maximum emission
wavelength (QY = 11.6% and emission at 715 nm) among all
the 21 nanoclusters of M29(S-Adm)18(PPh3)4. Based on these
structure-PL correlations, Kang et al. demonstrate that
doping the kernel or vertex atoms with metals of large
electron affinity (note: metal electron affinity subsequence
Au(2.309) > Pt(2.128) > Ag(1.302) > Cu(1.228) > Pd(0.562)) is
in favor of generating emissive nanoclusters with higher PL
intensity.448 Overall, the observed trends of PL with different
doping modes will provide guidelines in the synthesis of
fluorescent alloy nanoclusters.448
The PL characteristic of Pt1Ag12, Pt2Ag23, and Pt3Ag33
nanoclusters are compared as well. Among them, the monoicosahedral Pt1Ag12 shows the strongest PL with QY = 5.5%,
and the emission locates at 613 nm (Fig. 31b).445 Assembly of
two Pt1Ag12 units into Pt2Ag23 red-shifts the emission to 675
nm, but the PL QY drops to 0.2%. Further assembly results in
tri-icosahedral Pt3Ag33 which emits at 800 nm with a
neglectable PL QY of 0.013% (Fig. 31b).445

In order to study the PL characteristics of alloy clusters
based on C@Au6, alloyed C@Au6Cu2, C@Au6Ag2, C@Au6Ag4,
and C@Au6Ag6 clusters were obtained.586,591-594 C@Au6Mx (M
= Ag/Cu) alloy clusters exhibit ligand-dependent, metaldependent, and solvent-dependent PL performances ― (i)
C@Au6Mx cluster compounds with different peripheral
phosphine ligands or metal compositions display diverse
metal-ligand
coordinations
and
geometric/electronic

structures, and thus show distinguishable PL properties, such
as fluorescent colors;586,592-294 (ii) crystals of C@Au6Mx
clusters have porous structures, and show solvatochromic
performance because of the specific interactions between
the poles/channels and the solvent molecules.586,593

non-emissive, they undergo controlled aggregation with the
addition of Au0, and the aggregated product (Au2Cu6) displays
high PL at 663 nm with a QY of 11.7% (Fig. 32a).555
The weakly luminescent Au18(SG)14 emits high PL in the
presence of AgI ions (Fig. 32b).272 It is proposed that the
introduced AgI ions bridge the AuI-SG motifs on the surface of
Au18(SG)14, leading to the formation of rigid AuI/AgI-SG motifs,
which exhibit strong, red emission (PL QY = 6.8%) via AIE (Fig.
32b, right).272 The anchored AgI ions on Au18(SG)14 surface
can be removed upon the addition of cysteine, and as a result,
the Au18@Ag alloy nanocluster reverts to the weakly emissive
Au18(SG)14 (Fig. 32b, middle).272
Pal and co-workers modified the PL of dopamineprotected Au nanoclusters via Ag alloying, and a blue-shift of
the emission peak, as well as an enhancement in PL intensity
for the Au/Ag alloy in comparison to homo-gold nanocluster
in aqueous solution, are observed.597 Besides, the increment
of emission intensity is found to be silver concentrationdependent and a maximum 5-fold increase is obtained at
Ag:Au ratio = 0.25:0.60.597
7.1.3 Ultrafast electron dynamics
Alloying may exhibit effects on the electronic excited-state
properties of nanoclusters, including the transient absorption
spectral features and ultrafast electron dynamics.220 By using
femtosecond visible and near-infrared transient absorption
(TA) spectroscopies, Zhou et al. investigated the heteroatom
effects on ultrafast electron relaxation dynamics of
Pd1Au24(SR)18 and Pt1Au24(SR)18.220 Three relaxation
components were identified for both nanoclusters: (i) subpicosecond relaxation within the icosahedral M1Au12 (M =
Pd/Pt) kernel states (~0.6 ps); (2) kernel to shell relaxation in
a few picoseconds (3-5 ps); and (3) relaxation to the ground
state in more than one nanosecond. Despite similar
relaxation pathways for the two doped nanoclusters, the
coupling between the metal kernel and surface motifs was
found to be accelerated by about 30% in the case of Pt
dopant with ~3.8 ps compared with Pd dopant with ~5 ps (Fig.
33a).220 The different excited state and ground state
behaviors between Pd1Au24(SR)18 and Pt1Au24(SR)18 could be
attributed to the different hybridization of Pd 4d (or Pt 5d)
orbitals with Au 5d and 6s orbitals in the icosahedral M13

kernel.220 Later, Zhou et al. continued to explore more
M1Au24(SR)18 (M = Cd, Hg, Pt, Pd) nanoclusters, and the
excited-state behaviors of these nanoclusters demonstrated
that the number of valence electrons in M1Au24(SR)18
determined the photodynamics.221 The Cd1Au24(SR)18 and
Hg1Au24(SR)18 with 8 electrons showed long excited-state
lifetimes (50-200 ns) and weak picosecond relaxations,
similar to the case of [Au25(SR)18]- (8 e) (Fig. 33b). In contrast,
Pd1Au24(SR)18 and Pt1Au24(SR)18 with 6 e showed much more
significant picosecond relaxation and thus much shorter
excited-state lifetimes (> 1 ns), reminiscent of the 7-electron
[Au25(SR)18]0 nanocluster.221
Thanthirige et al. carried out femtosecond TA
measurements on Au25(SR)18, Hg1Au24(SR)18 and Pt1Au24(SR)18
nanoclusters after exciting them at 370 nm, to gain a better
understanding on the influence of the central metal atom on
the optical properties.598 Compared with Au25(SR)18, Ptdoping led to a faster excited state relaxation, where more
than 70% of the created electron-hole pairs recombined
within 20 ps. By comparison, Hg1Au24 took a much longer
time for relaxing exciton to the shell gold before
recombination, similar to the case of Au25(SR)18 (over 100 ns
in exciton relaxation).598 These results are consistent with the
energy gaps of these nanoclusters, in which the smaller
energy gap for Pt1Au24(SR)18 leads to a faster exciton
relaxation.598
Aside from Au25(SR)18, alloying effects on ultrafast
electron dynamics were also investigated in other
nanoclusters.370,407 The ultrafast relaxation dynamics of rodshaped Au25(PPh3)10(SR)5Cl2 and Au25-xAgx(PPh3)10(SR)5Cl2
were compared: the excited state relaxation in Au25
proceeded with an ultrafast (0.82 ps) internal conversion and
a subsequent nuclear relaxation (52 ps), followed by a slow
(2.3 μs) decay back to the ground state.370 Upon Ag-doping,
Au25-xAgx showed a 0.58 ps internal conversion, a 20.7 ps
nuclear relaxation, and a 7.4 μs final decay to the ground
state.370 Zheng et al. researched the composition-dependent
electronic energy relaxation dynamics of doped Au144xAgx(SR)60, and demonstrated a trend of greater electronphonon coupling efficiency with increasing Ag content in
Au144-xAgx.410

7.2 Electrochemical properties
Electrochemistry reveals the energies of the HOMO and
LUMO (associated with the energy gap), and represents one
of the important properties of nanoclusters.599-604 The
alloying effects on electrochemical properties have been
investigated based on several nanocluster models, which are
reviewed in this section.
Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was used to
compare the electrochemical properties of Au18(SR)14 and
doped Au15Ag3(SR)14 nanoclusters (in 0.1 M Bu4NPF6-CH2Cl2
solution, room temperature).267 The Au18(SR)14 exhibited
three oxidation peaks at 0.660 (O1), 0.949 (O2), and 1.292 V
(O3), and one reduction peak at -1.253 V (R1). Upon Agdoping, Au15Ag3(SR)14 had three oxidation peaks at 0.837 (O1),
1.087 (O2), and 1.483 V (O3), and two reduction peaks at 1.273 (R1) and -1.591 V (R2). Based on the peaks, the HOMOLUMO energy gap (i.e., the difference between O1 and R1) of
Au15Ag3(SR)14 was calculated as 2.110 eV, larger than that of
Au18(SR)14 (1.913 eV).267
The square wave voltammetry (SWV) analysis was
conducted on Au25(SR)18, Pd1Au24(SR)18 and Pt1Au24(SR)18
nanoclusters to investigate the doping effects on
electrochemical properties.211 For Au25(SR)18, there were
three oxidation peaks at -0.39 (O1), -0.04 (O2), and 0.69 (O3),
and one reduction peak at -2.06 V (R1). By comparison,
Pd1Au24(SR)18 exhibited a doublet of oxidation at -0.03 (O1)
and 0.40 (O2), and a doublet of reduction at -0.78 (R1) and 1.10 V (R2); similarly, Pt1Au24(SR)18 also exhibited a doublet of
oxidation at -0.03 (O1) and 0.41 (O2) and a doublet of
reduction at -0.76 (R1) and -1.10 V (R2) (Fig. 34a).211
Accordingly, upon Pd- and Pt-doping, the HOMO-LUMO gap
was remarkably reduced from 1.32 V of Au25(SR)18 to 0.32 V
of Pd1Au24(SR)18 and 0.29 V of Pt1Au24(SR)18, respectively.211

In the comparison of DPV spectra between Au25(SR)18 and
mono-Hg-doped Hg1Au24(SR)18, the O1 and R1 potential
bands of Au25 located at -0.15 and -1.78 V, respectively, while
those of Hg1Au24(SR)18 red-shifted to 0.38 and -1.14 V,
respectively. In this context, the O1-R1 potential spacing was
reduced from 1.63 V of Au25(SR)18 to 1.52 V of
Hg1Au24(SR)18.71
Electrochemical properties of Au38(SR)24 and Pt- and Pddoped M2Au36(SR)24 nanoclusters were compared as well (Fig.
34b).262 The SWV spectra of Au38(SR)24 showed three
oxidation peaks at -0.10 (O1), 0.25 (O2), and 0.47 V (O3), and
two reduction peaks at -1.31 (R1) and -1.52 V (R2). Upon Ptdoping, Pt2Au36(SR)24 exhibited three oxidation peaks at -0.40
(O1), -0.08 (O2), and 0.30 (O3), and one reduction peak at 1.67 V (R1). As for Pd2Au36(SR)24, a doublet of oxidation at 0.15 (O1) and 0.17 (O2), and a doublet of reduction at -0.73
(R1) and -1.02 V (R2) were observed (Fig. 34b). From these
potential bands, the HOMO-LUMO energy gaps of Au38(SR)24,
Pt2Au36(SR)24, and Pd2Au36(SR)24 nanoclusters were
determined as 0.86, 0.95, and 0.26 V, respectively.262 Lee and
co-workers proposed that the similar voltammograms
between [Au38(SR)24]0 and [Pt2Au36(SR)24]2- resulted from
similar electronic structures with 14-electron configurations
of these two nanoclusters; while [Pd2Au36(SR)24]0 displayed a
drastically reduced HOMO-LUMO energy gap due to its 12electron configuration.262
Doping effects on the electrochemical properties were
also evaluated on M1Ag24(SR)18 (M = Ag/Au/Pd/Pt)
nanoclusters.441 From the DPV spectra, the HOMO-LUMO
energy gaps of Ag25(SR)18, Au1Ag24(SR)18, Pd1Ag24(SR)18, and
Pt1Ag24(SR)18 were determined to be 1.82, 1.76, 1.71, and
1.96 V, respectively (Fig. 34c), consistent with the
corresponding optical gaps of these nanoclusters.441

7.3 Electroluminescence properties
Electrogenerated
chemiluminescence
(ECL)
or
electrochemiluminescence received great interest in these
years. Generally, the electroactive nanoclusters are oxidized
or reduced at the electrode under appropriate potentials to
form active species which will relax to the ground state and
emit light. Scheme 3 shows the mechanism of ECL of
nanoclusters.385 Scheme 3a represents the transient oxidative
ECL of nanoclusters (at the electrode surface vicinity from
negative potential to positive potential): an electron is first
injected into the LUMO of [cluster] to generate [cluster]-•;

then the cathodically produced radicals are oxidized once the
electrode potential is stepped below HOMO, producing the
excited species [cluster]*, which relaxes to the ground state
and emits light. Scheme 3b represents the transient reductive
ECL of nanoclusters (from negative potential to positive
potential) and the generation of excited species [cluster]* is
contrary to the oxidative process. By comparison, Scheme 3c
represents the self-annihilation ECL, wherein the diffusive
reaction between two types of radical intermediates
generates excited [cluster]*, which then releases the energy
via photon emission.385

Scheme 3 Illustration of the mechanism of ECL of
nanoclusters. Redrawn from ref. 385 with permission from

ECL has been studied on Au25(SR)18, Au38(SR)24, and
Au144(SR)60 nanoclusters under co-reactant pathways.241,605610 Besides, ECL analysis has been applied to some alloy
nanoclusters, which are reviewed in this section.
In 2019, intense NIR ECL from rod-like bimetallic
Au12Ag13(PPh3)10(SR)5Cl2 was reported by Chen et al. (Fig.
35a).385 With the ECL standard Ru(bpy)3 (bpy: bipyridine) as a
reference, the self-annihilation ECL of Au12Ag13 was ~10 times
higher. More significantly, the co-reactant ECL of Au12Ag13
with 1 mM tripropylamine as a co-reactant was ~400 times
stronger than Ru(bpy)3. Potential step experiments were
performed to capture the transient ECL signals (tens of
milliseconds) and decay profiles.385 A strong and transient
self-annihilation ECL of Au12Ag13 was detected by activating
LUMO and HOMO states sequentially via electrode reactions.
Besides, based on the key anodic and cathodic activities
arising from the energetics of Au12Ag13, the ECL generation
pathways and mechanism were proposed―the origin of
strong ECL in Au12Ag13 was attributed to the 13th Ag atom at
the sharing vertex position that stabilized the electron on the
LUMO orbital and made the rod-like nanocluster more
rigid.385 The insights, elucidated from both femtosecond
spectroscopy and DFT calculations, suggested reduced

nonradiative decays and thus, enhanced PL and ECL.370,385 Of
note, the ECL intensity of rod-like Au12Ag13 is the record-high
among all reports.385
Wang et al. analyzed the ECL of Au/Ag and Pt/Ag
nanoclusters.611 By controlling the pH of the buffer solution
to 8.5, the ECL intensity of Au/Ag nanoclusters showed a ~20fold enhancement. The ECL was remarkably affected by
oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, which was attributed to the
accelerated production of reactive oxygen species on the
nanoclusters. Besides, the ECL was also affected by phenolic
artificial estrogens, which in turn, determined their detection
limits as low as 700 pg L-1 for Au/Ag nanoclusters, and 1.6 ng
L-1 for Pt/Ag nanoclusters, respectively.611
The low ECL efficiency of mono-metallic, GSH-Au
nanoclusters limits their applications in ECL sensing. Thus,
Xiao and co-workers pursued an alloying strategy to obtain
bi-metallic GSH-Au/Ag nanoclusters, finding that the ECL
efficiency of the Au/Ag nanocluster/S2O82- system was much
higher than that of the homo-gold system.612 Based on this
high ECL property of Au/Ag nanoclusters, an ultrasensitive
ECL sensor was constructed for the detection of dopamine
(Fig. 35b) as the presence of dopamine would significantly
quench the ECL of Au/Ag nanoclusters.612 The quenching
reactions brought by dopamine were proposed as: (i) Au/Ag
cluster• + SO4• → Au/Ag cluster* + SO42- and (ii) Au/Ag
cluster* → Au/Ag cluster + hν. The cluster-based ECL sensor
exhibited excellent sensitivity, selectivity, and stability, and
had a wide linear range from 10 nM to 1 mM with a low
detection limit of 2.3 nM.612
A series of GSH-stabilized, Au/Ag nanoclusters via
controlling the molar ratios of HAuCl4/AgNO3 precursors were
synthesized, and their ECL were analyzed using the
trimethylamine (TEA) as a co-reactant.613 Compared with the
mono-metallic Au nanoclusters, Au/Ag nanoclusters exhibited
significantly enhanced ECL with decreased peak potential and
onset potential, and thus, could be used for sensing Hg2+
metal ions. Specifically, as depicted in Fig. 35c, the electron
transfer between Au/Ag nanoclusters and TEA resulted in
ECL; by comparison, the presence of Hg2+ ions would stop the
electron transfer, and thus quench ECL. This cluster-based
Hg2+ sensor exhibited a low detection limit, broad linear
range, and good sensitivity and stability.613

7.4 Magnetic properties
Magnetism in nanoclusters is intriguing, as the number of
free electrons in atomically precise nanoclusters can be
precisely counted.614-617 [Au25(SR)18]-1 has a superatomic 8electron configuration, whereas [Au25(SR)18]0 bears 7
electrons, and thus, contains an unpaired electron.618
Accordingly, the magnetic properties turned from
diamagnetism in [Au25(SR)18]-1 to paramagnetism in
[Au25(SR)18]0.495,618-620 The Pt- or Pt-doping in [Au25(SR)18]0 is
capable of altering the electronic configuration, and further
change the magnetic properties of this nanocluster.216 As
shown in Fig. 36, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
spectroscopy demonstrates that both [Pd1Au24(SR)18]0 and
[Pt1Au24(SR)18]0 are diamagnetic, in contrast to the
paramagnetic [Au25(SR)18]0.216 It is suggested that the
transformation of the superatom electronic structure from 7electron of [Au25(SR)18]0 to 6-electron of [Pd1Au24(SR)18]0 and
[Pt1Au24(SR)18]0 turns the magnetism from paramagnetism to
diamagnetism.216

Although there is no unpaired electron in the electronic
structure of [Pt1Au24(SR)18]0, the monoanion [Pt1Au24(SR)18]-1
contains an unpaired electron, and is thus EPR active.222 The
EPR signal of [Pt1Au24(SR)18]-1 (g = (2.572, 2.366, 1.749)) is
very similar to that of [Au25(SR)18]0 (g = (2.56, 2.36, 1.82)),618
suggesting that the contribution of spin densities to the 1P
superatomic orbitals are comparable between the central Pt
in Pt1Au24(SR)18 and the central Au in Au25(SR)18.222
It is suggested that the most characteristic feature for the
planar π-aromatics is its ability to sustain a long-range
shielding cone under the magnetic fields oriented in a specific
direction.621 Fedik et al. analyzed the aromatic character of
[Au13]5+ and [M1Au12]4+/6+ (M = Pd, Pt) kernels in M1Au24(SR)18
(M = Au, Pd, Pt) nanoclusters, finding that both [Au25(SR)18]and [M1Au24(SR)18]2- presented inherent spherical aromatic
properties ascribed to their icosahedral [Au13]5+ and
[M1Au12]4+ kernels.621 However, the [M1Au12]6+ kernels in
[M1Au24(SR)18]0 (M = Pd, Pt) nanoclusters represented a 6e
superatom structure, which exhibited characteristics for
planar σ-aromatics, totally different from the spherical one in
8e nanoclusters. Accordingly, similar magnetic responses

silver content.253 The Cu1Au38(SR)24 alloy nanocluster also
shows different CD responses with respect to the parent
Au38(SR)24 nanocluster.253

7.5 Chiral properties
A chiral nanocluster is non-superimposable with its mirror
image, and the chirality in nanoclusters is endowed by their
asymmetric structures. Alloying can serve as an effective
means to alter the structures of nanoclusters; thus, alloying
can be utilized to control the chiral properties.
Yao and co-workers measured the circular dichroism (CD)
spectra of –SG protected Au15(SG)13, Au18(SG)14, and
Au25(SG)18
nanoclusters.622,623
All
three
homo-gold
nanoclusters display CD signals in the metal-based electronic
transition region (300-600 nm). Upon Ag-doping, the CD
responses exhibit quite a difference: (i) the CD signals of
Au15(SG)13 disappear in Au12.2Ag2.8(SR)13; (ii) the non-obvious
CD response in Au18(SG)14 is enhanced in Au14.4Ag3.6(SG)14,
with distinct signals at ~280, 310, 340 and 410 nm; (iii) as for
Au25(SG)18, their CD signals are nearly reversed after Agdoping.623
Au38(SR)24 exhibits intense CD responses at 350, 400, 450,
480, 570 and 630 nm.244 Pd-doping into Au38(SR)24 leads to a
significant change in CD responses, although the anisotropy
factors of Au38(SR)24 and Pd2Au36(SR)24 are of similar
magnitude.259 Specifically, the CD signals of Pd2Au36(SR)24 are
broader and not as distinct as those of Au38(SR)24 (Fig. 37a). In
addition, racemization of chiral Pd2Au36(SR)24 occurs at a
significantly lower temperature than does the parent
Au38(SR)24 nanocluster, reflecting in different activation
parameters.259 Bürgi and co-workers proposed that Pddoping would increase the flexibility of the nanocluster
surface, which resulted in weakened CD signals of
Pd2Au36(SR)24 compared to Au38(SR)24.259 Similar doping
effects are also observed in Au38-xAgx(SR)24 nanoclusters.253 As
shown in Fig. 37b/c, the more Ag heteroatoms are doped in
Au38(SR)24, the broader the CD peaks are. Besides, the
temperature required for complete racemization follow an
order (high to low): Au38(SR)24 > Au38-xAgx(SR)24 (x = 6.5) >
Au38-xAgx(SR)24 (x = 7.9). Significantly, racemization of AgxAu38253 Therefore, the chiral
x(SR)24 (x =7.9) occurs even at 20 °C.

Based on DFT calculations on Au38(SR)24 and its Pd- and
Ag-doped derivatives, Häkkinen and co-workers proposed a
mechanism for chiral inversion that did not require the
breaking of Au-S bonds at the metal-ligand interface, but
featured a collective rotation of the kernel.624 The calculated
energy barriers of kernel rotation for Au38(SR)24 and
Pd2Au36(SR)24 are in the range of 1-1.5 eV, significantly lower
than the barriers involving breakage of Au-S bonds (2.5 eV).
On the other hand, for Ag-doped Au38, the barriers for both
mechanisms (kernel rotation and Au-S bond breakage) are
similar (1.3-1.5 eV).624 Such results are in a good agreement
with the racemization barriers estimated from the
experiments.624
7.6 Stability and reactivity
Stability and reactivity are of great significance in the
applications of nanoclusters.14 Alloying serves as a frequently
used method to enhance the stability or reactivity of
nanoclusters.
Generally speaking, the alloying strategy can be used to
enhance the thermal stability of nanoclusters, such as the
Au15Ag3(SR)14 nanocluster, which showed no change in its
optical absorption spectrum after 24 hours at 60 oC; for
comparison, Au18(SR)14 showed a decrease in absorption

intensity after 2 hrs and the peaks completely disappeared in
~6 hrs.256 These results show that the stability of Au18(SR)14
was drastically enhanced upon Ag-doping. For M25(SR)18,
Negishi et al. mixed Au25(SR)18 and Pd1Au24(SR)18 nanoclusters
at 50 oC, and after 30 days, only Pd1Au24(SR)18 survived.204
Compared to Ag44(p-MBA)30, the Au-doped Au12Ag32(pMBA)30 showed enhanced stability at room temperature,

with unchanged optical absorption over 30 days (Fig. 38a,
middle). Besides, Au12Ag32(p-MBA)30 could sustain at 150 oC
for 2 hrs (Fig. 38a, left).493 However, alloying does not always
enhance the thermal stability of nanoclusters. By substituting
the central Cu with Au in Cu13(S2CNnBu2)6(C≡CR)4, the stability
can be enhanced, whereas doping with Ag acts in an opposite
way.518

Doping can also tune the reactivity of nanoclusters.
Negishi and co-workers investigated the ligand-exchange
reactivity of Au25(SR)18 and its Pd-, Ag-, and Cu-doped
nanoclusters.180,205 They found that the doped M25(SR)18
nanoclusters exhibited remarkably enhanced ligand-exchange
reactivity.180,205 As shown in Fig. 38b, when Au25(S-C2H4Ph)18
reacted with HS-C8H17, only an average of 1.58 S-C2H4Ph
ligands could be exchanged, while for Pd1Au24(SR)18, ~7.54 SC2H4Ph ligands were exchanged. The Ag- and Cu-doping can
also enhance the efficiency in ligand exchange reactions, and
the enhancement is more obvious for Au25-xCux(SR)18 (Fig.
38b).180 Besides, the more Ag or Cu heteroatoms are

introduced into Au25-xMx(SR)18 (M = Ag/Cu), the more
efficient ligand-exchange the nanoclusters exhibit.180
By exploiting the free valence electron centralization
strategy, Kang et al. rendered the moderately stable
Ag29(S2R)12(PPh3)4 with ultra-stability via heteroatom
doping.468 Specifically, the thermal stability of mono-metallic
Ag29(S2R)12(PPh3)4 (stable at 80 °C) was significantly enhanced
in bi-metallic Ag17Cu12(S2R)12(PPh3)4 (stable at 110 °C), and
even more improved in tri-metallic Au1Ag16Cu12(S2R)12(PPh3)4
(stable at 155 °C, boiling DMF).468 Due to the differences of
metal activity in these alloyed M29 nanoclusters, substituting
the parent kernel Ag atoms with more inert Au (or
exchanging the parent shell Ag atoms with more active Cu)

would concentrate the free electrons from the outer shell to
the inner kernel. Thus, the kernel metals would more likely
present a M0 state, while the shell metals will be in more
oxidized states (i.e., Mδ+). This phenomenon can also be
understood by the different electronegativity of group 11
atoms (i.e., Cu < Ag < Au), as atoms of lower electronegativity

tend to transfer partial charge to those of higher
electronegativity.279 Consequently, the obtained alloy
nanoclusters possess a surface that is harder to be oxidized
and thus, higher thermo-stability relative to the parent Ag29
nanocluster.468

Based on M29(S-Adm)18(PPh3)4 (M = Ag/Au/Pt/Pd/Cu)
nanoclusters, Kang et al. investigated the inter-metallic
synergy effects on their thermal stability by monitoring the
time-dependent optical absorption of these nanoclusters.448
Some structure-stability correlations were obtained: (i) for
the kernel (M = Ag/Au/Pt/Pd), the stability sequence is
Pd1M28 < Ag1M28 < Au1M28 ≈ Pt1M28; (ii) for the 2nd-shell (M =
Ag/Cu), substituting the Ag12(SR)18 shell with Cu12(SR)18
enhances the stability; and (iii) for the vertex position (M =
Ag/Cu/Au), the stability sequence is M25Cu4 > M25Ag4 >>
M25Au4. These correlations between the metal positions and
the stability of nanoclusters agree with the energy changes of
nanoclusters derived from DFT calculations.448

8 Applications of Alloy Nanoclusters
Alloying is able to endow nanoclusters with enhanced
chemical/physical properties (e.g., PL properties), which have
been reviewed in Section 7. Furthermore, such enhanced
properties provide alloy nanoclusters with more potential in
applications. In this section, the applications of alloy
nanoclusters are reviewed, including catalysis and optical
applications.
8.1 Catalysis by alloy nanoclusters
Compared to mono-metallic nanoclusters, alloy nanoclusters
have shown great potential for many important chemical
transformation reactions owing to their enhanced activity
and selectivity induced by intermetallic synergies.625
Tsukuda and co-workers loaded Au25(SR)18 or
Pd1Au24(SR)18 nanoclusters onto multiwalled carbon
nanotubes, and compared the catalytic performance of these
composites in aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol.64 The
mono-Pd doped nanocluster remarkably improved the
conversion from 22% for Au25(SR)18 to 74% (Fig. 39a).64 Yao et
al. incorporated two additional Ag heteroatoms onto the
surface of Au25(SR)18, and the alloyed Ag2Au25(SR)18
nanocluster displayed enhanced catalytic conversion to 52%
for hydrolysis of 1,3-diphenyl-2-propynyl acetate (c.f. only
11% conversion over Au25(SR)18).184 Yan et al. obtained a
correlated series of nanoclusters from mono-metallic
Au25(SR)18 to bi-metallic Au25-xAgx(SR)18 and Au24Hg1(SR)18,
and tri-metallic Au24-xAgxHg1(SR)18, and compared their
catalytic activities in reducing 4-nitrophenol.521 As shown in
Fig. 39b, the catalytic yields over Au25, Au25-xAgx, Au24Hg1, and
Au24-xAgxHg1 nanoclusters are 23%, 41%, 48%, and 91%,
respectively.521 Alloying the DNA-stabilized Ag nanoclusters
with Pd, Au, or Pt heteroatoms can enhance the catalytic
efficiency in reducing 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol.626 Li
and co-workers enhanced the CO oxidation performance of
Au25(SR)18 by Ag- or Cu-doping, and DFT calculations
suggested that the enhanced adsorption of CO on the
nanocluster surface induced by Cu or Ag heteroatoms
resulted in the enhancement of catalytic activity.181 Wu and
co-workers alloyed Au25(SR)18 with Cd(PPh3)2(NO3)2, and

obtained a Cd5Au26 alloy nanocluster.627 For comparison,
Au25(SR)18 exhibited no catalytic activity toward A3-coupling
reaction between phenylacetylene, benzaldehyde, and
pyrrolidine, but Cd5Au26 showed a high catalytic activity (up
to 92% conversion) as well as good recyclability and substrate
tolerance. The remarkably enhanced catalytic activity was
attributed to the cooperation between Cd and adjacent Au
atoms in the nanocluster.627 The PVP-stabilized Au34
nanoclusters displayed a relatively low conversion (< 1%) for
the hydrogenation of C=C bonds in 1-dodecene, styrene, and
cyclooctene, while upon Pd- or Rh-alloying, the catalytic
activities were significantly enhanced.583 For example, the
catalytic conversion over PVP-Au34 in hydrogenating styrene
was only 1%, whereas PVP-Pd1Au33 and PVP-Rh1Au33 showed
remarkably enhanced conversions of 33% and 95%,
respectively.583
Based on Ag25(SR)18 and doped Au1Ag24(SR)18,
Pt1Ag24(SR)18, Pd1Ag24(SR)18 nanoclusters, the doping effects
on catalytic performance were investigated in the
carboxylation reaction of CO2 with terminal alkyne through CC bond formation to produce propiolic acid.440 As shown in
Fig. 39c, Au-, Pd-, and Pt-doping are all able to enhance the
catalytic activity of Ag25(SR)18 in carboxylation reactions. The
order of catalytic activity is Au1Ag24(SR)18 > Pd1Ag24(SR)18 ≈
Pt1Ag24(SR)18 > Ag25(SR)18.440
The ultra-stable Au1Ag16Cu12(S2R)12(PPh3)4 was obtained
by doping Ag29(S2R)12(PPh3)4 with Au and Cu heteroatoms.468
Owing to its high stability, Au1Ag16Cu12(S2R)12(PPh3)4 enabled
the multicomponent A3 coupling reaction at high
temperatures, which remarkably shortened the catalytic
reaction time from ~24 h in previous works to 3 min, with
high
conversion,
good
selectivity,
and
excellent
recyclability.468
Wang et al. explored the alloying effects of surfacealloying in Au24Ag46(SR)32 and core-shell alloying in
Au12Ag32(SR)30 for the reaction of styrene oxidization.549 As
shown in Fig. 39d, epoxide and benzaldehyde are the major
products in the styrene oxidation. The surface-alloying in the
Au24Ag46(SR)32/CNT (i.e., nanoclusters loaded on multi-walled
carbon nanotubes) catalyst displayed high selectivity for
benzaldehyde (96.3%), whereas the core-shell alloying in the
Au12Ag32(SR)30/CNT composite showed a much higher
epoxide selectivity (57.6%).549 In follow-up works, styrene
oxidation was used for evaluating the catalytic conversion
and selectivity over Au25(SR)18, Ag44(SR)30, Au25-xAgx(SR)18, and
Au12Ag32(SR)30 nanoclusters.628 The catalytic results
demonstrated that the silver atoms in alloy nanoclusters
were responsible for the high selectivity for benzaldehyde
and the gold atoms were responsible for the high
conversion.628
The Au/Ag synergistic effect in the alkynylation of CF3ketone was evaluated over bi-metallic Au1Ag24(SR)18 and Au25xAgx(SR)18 (x = 2-6) nanoclusters, and their corresponding
mono-metallic counterparts (Ag25(SR)18 and Au25(SR)18) were
used as reference catalysts.629 By a combination of
experimental and theoretical analyses, Sun et al.

demonstrated that the Au@Ag kernel (i.e., M13 icosahedral
kernel) was essential for high activity and stability in the
cluster-catalyzed alkynylation of CF3-ketone. Besides, such a
structure-property correlation was extended to other Au/Ag
bi-metallic nanoclusters such as Au12Ag32(SR)30, which
brought more opportunities for designing alloy catalysts with
high reactivity and stability.629
Du et al. compared the photocatalytic activities of
Ag25(SR)18 and Pt1Ag24(SR)18 nanoclusters (loaded on graphitic
carbon nitride (g-C3N4)) in hydrogen evolution, and
Pt1Ag24(SR)18/g-C3N4 displayed the highest photocatalytic
activity, which was ~330 times and ~4 times higher than bare
g-C3N4 and Ag25(SR)18/g-C3N4, respectively (Fig. 40a).630 Such

catalysts were further compared via various photoelectrochemical characterizations to investigate the detailed
alloying effects. Unlike bare g-C3N4 and Ag25(SR)18/g-C3N4,
Pt1Ag24(SR)18/g-C3N4 showed a remarkably reduced semicircle
in the Nyquist plot (Fig. 40a, bottom-left), demonstrating that
a small barrier of photocarrier transfer could be achieved
based on the Pt1Ag24(SR)18/g-C3N4 composite. In addition,
photocurrent versus time curves of these catalysts were
compared (Fig. 40a, bottom-right), and Pt1Ag24(SR)18/g-C3N4
displayed a significant photocurrent enhancement compared
to Ag25(SR)18/g-C3N4, not to mention the pristine g-C3N4.630

The visible-light-induced catalytic denitrification coupling
of benzylamine by nanoclusters was investigated on the
Au25(SR)18, Ag25(SR)18, and Au25-xAgx(SR)18 nanoclusters.631
Basically, two products were observed in the oxidation of
benzylamine ― N-benzylidenebenzylamine and aldimine ―
the former was the desired product. The Ag25(SR)18 gave a
complete conversion (100%), but with a relatively low
selectivity for N-benzylidenebenzylamine (29.1%). The
Au25(SR)18 showed a higher selectivity (~70%) and a
conversion of ~80%. Significantly, the bi-metallic Au25xAgx(SR)18 nanoclusters were found to be the best among
these catalysts, exhibiting a complete conversion (> 99%) and
an exclusive selectivity (100%).631
Lee’s group investigated the alloying effects on hydrogen
evolution reaction (HER) catalyzed by Pt- and Pd-doped
M1Au24(SR)18 and M2Au36(SR)24 nanoclusters.217-219,632 Similar
to the hydrogenase enzymes that showed active sites at the
intersection of an electron-transport chain and a protontransport chain (e.g., [FeFe] hydrogenase, shown in Fig. 40b,
middle-left),633-635 the nanoclusters possessed similar
configurations containing several intersected Mx(SR)y staple
motifs (shown in Fig. 40b, middle-right), and thus, these
nanoclusters showed high electrocatalytic activity in HER.217219 The k
obs was used to define the efficiency of HER, and
Pt1Au24(SR)18 (SR = 3-mercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid, MPS,
or 1-hexanethiolate, C6S) nanoclusters showed remarkably
enhanced kobs values relative to their homo-gold counterparts
(Fig. 40b, bottom-left).217,219 Significantly, the HER efficiency
of the Pt1Au24(SR)18-based catalysts was determined as 25
mol g-1 h-1, which was more than two times higher than that
of the benchmarking Pt/C-based catalyst (11 mol g-1 h-1) at
the same overpotential of 0.6 V.217 Lee and co-workers also
demonstrated that Pt- and Pd-doping were able to enhance
the catalytic efficiencies of Au38(SR)24 in HER.632 DFT
calculations reveal that the hydrogen adsorption free energy
(∆GH) is significantly reduced in doped nanoclusters, with the
order of Au25(SR)18 > Pd1Au24(SR)18 > Pt1Au24(SR)18 and
similarly, Au38(SR)24 > Pd2Au36(SR)24 > Pt2Au36(SR)24, indicating
that
hydrogen
adsorption
on
active
sites
is
thermodynamically favored by Pd- or Pt-doping.632 The doped
metals, albeit buried in the kernel of Au25(SR)18 and Au38(SR)24,
have a profound impact on the HER activity by altering the
reduction potentials and hydrogen adsorption free energies
of the corresponding nanoclusters.632
The electrocatalytic activities of Au25(SR)18 and
Pt1Au24(SR)18 were compared in direct oxidation of formic
acid into carbon dioxide.636 It was observed that Au25(SR)18
was inactive in this catalytic reaction, but Pt1Au24(SR)18
exhibited a relatively high activity of 3.7 A mgPt+Au-1, which
was 12 and 34 times greater than Pt nanoclusters and
commercial Pt/C catalysts, respectively. DFT calculations also
demonstrated the importance of Pt-doping in reducing the
energy barrier of formic acid oxidation.636

Negishi and co-workers studied the heteroatom doping
effect of the co-catalyst on water-splitting activity by loading
Pd1Au24(SR)18 or Pt1Ag24(SR)18 nanoclusters on BaLa4Ti4O15
(one of the most advanced photocatalysts).637 Experimental
results of these photocatalysts revealed the following three
features of heteroatom doping on cocatalysts: (i) Pd was
located on the surface of the cluster cocatalyst, whereas Pt
was at the interface between the cluster cocatalyst and the
photocatalyst; (ii) Pd doping decreased the water-splitting
activity, whereas Pt doping improved it; and (iii) the doping
position of the heteroatom considerably contributed to the
doping effect.637
In parallel with the experimental results, DFT calculations
were performed to investigate the mechanisms of (i) alloyinginduced enhancement in catalytic activities, and (ii)
atomically precise processes of catalysis based on alloy
nanoclusters.217,218,632,636-640 Based on these DFT calculations,
alloying can promote the catalytic processes because of its
capability in changing the adsorption energy of substrates (i.e.
reactants), helping the stabilization of catalytic intermediates,
and reducing the energy barrier of the reactions.217,218,632,636640

8.2 Nanocluster-based, fluorescent sensors for detection of
toxic ions
Fluorescent alloy nanoclusters have been developed as highly
sensitive and selective sensors for detecting metal ions. In
this section, nanocluster-based sensors for detecting various
ions are reviewed.
Jiang et al. prepared red fluorescent BSA-Au nanoclusters
that emitted at 620 nm,641 and the presence of Ag+ ions
would not only blue-shift the emission to 585 nm, but also
enhance the PL intensity significantly. By contrast, all other
metal ions (such as Au3+, Ca2+, Mn2+, etc.) induced
comparable emission intensities of this nanocluster, while
Hg2+ completely quenched the emission. Besides, based on
PL-enhanced BSA-Au/Ag alloy nanoclusters, the addition of
Hg2+ ions also quenched the emission (Fig. 41a). Accordingly,
the fluorescent BSA-Au nanoclusters could serve as a
versatile sensor for selectively detecting both Ag+ and Hg2+
ions.641
Chen and co-workers prepared a mercaptosuccinic acid
(MSA) stabilized fluorescent Au/Ag alloy nanocluster, and
further capped it with methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol)-NH2 (mPEG-NH2).642 The as-prepared alloy nanocluster emitted at
637 nm, and as the presence of Al3+ ions significantly
enhanced the fluorescence, the PEGylated MSA-Ag/Au
nanocluster could serve as a highly selective and sensitive
sensor for detecting Al3+ ions in aqueous solution, with a
detection limit of 0.8 μM (Fig. 41b).642
Sannigrahi et al. prepared a series of SG-protected Au/Ag
alloy nanoclusters with tunable NIR fluorescence, and the PL
intensity of such clusters could be significantly enhanced by
the addition of Pb2+ ions.643

co-workers found that the phosphorescent C@Au6Ag2 alloy
cluster selectively stained the nucleolus of LO2, Hela, and KB
cells (Fig. 42b) with a much lower uptake in the nucleus and
cytoplasm, and exhibited excellent photo-stability. Thus,
C@Au6Ag2 alloy is a very attractive phosphorescent staining
reagent for visualizing the nucleolus of living cells.587
Zan et al. synthesized a series of Ag44-xAux nanoclusters
capped by tiopronin (abbrev. Tio, a thiol) and further
modified these nanoclusters with doxorubicin (DOX, an
anticancer drug for a wide range of malignancies).644 The
obtained Ag44-xAux-Tio-DOX showed a red, intense emission
at 595 nm, and could be used as a multifunctional cancer
therapy platform with both imaging and therapy activities,
and thus had potential in anti-cancer diagnosis.644
Yang et al. prepared C@Au6Ag2 alloy complex capped by
2-(diphenylphosphino)-5-pyridinecarboxaldehyde, and the
terminal aldehyde groups on the surface were able to link the
dissociative mono-amines in solution.590 Significantly, the
adsorption of chiral mono-amine induced the asymmetric
torsion of the complex, and therefore, the R-Ag2Au6 and SAg2Au6 enantiomers were obtained and showed opposite CD
signals (Fig. 42c, left).590 Besides, a linear relationship was
determined between the e.e. values of introduced chiral
mono-amines (1-phenylethylamine, 1-cyclohexylethylamine,
or 2-aminooctane) and the intensity of CD signals (Fig. 42c,
right).590

8.3 Other applications of alloy nanoclusters
Some alloy nanoclusters have been used for labeling cells
owing to their (i) strong luminescence, (ii) ultra-small size, (iii)
ability to easily enter cells, (iv) good biocompatibility, and (v)
good photo-stability.368,587 Wang et al. prepared Au25xAgx(PPh3)10(SC2H4OH)5Cl2 (x < 13) alloy nanoclusters with
red-emission at 633 nm, displaying good water solubility and
capability in labeling the living cells (e.g., human cancer cell
7402, Fig. 42a). The wide excitation range and the red
emission make these nanoclusters feasible for simultaneous
use with other dyes having emissions shorter than 600 nm
(e.g., the most MitoTracker and LysoTracker) without any
interference
(Fig.
42a).

9 Conclusions and Perspectives
Atom-precise alloying has shown its unique capability in
dictating the electronic/geometrical structures and tuning the
chemical/physical properties of mono-metal nanoclusters. To
date, Au, Ag, Pt, Pd, Cu, Cd, Hg, Ir, etc., have been
incorporated into the templates, resulting in bi-, tri-, and
multi-metallic nanoclusters. Different metal atoms with
distinct electronic configurations and physicochemical
characteristics adopt different alloying modes, i.e., different
heteroatom(s) follow unique doping preference. For example,
based on Au25(SR)18, only one Pt/Pd can be doped into the
central position,216 whereas more than one Ag atoms can be
incorporated, and they tend to be arranged on the
icosahedral-kernel shell.174 On the other hand, for the
templates that are not electronic shell-closing, e.g., Au21(SR)15
and Au23(SR)16, structural transformation may be triggered by
alloying.
Collectively, based on different types of heteroatoms,
nanocluster templates, and doping modes, alloy nanoclusters
have presented their explosive developments in terms of
syntheses, characterizations, and structural determinations.

Alloying is also able to tune the chemical/physical
properties of homo-metal nanoclusters, including the optical,
electrochemical, magnetic and chiral properties, as well as
stability and reactivity. Owning to the inter-metallic
synergistic effects, alloy nanoclusters often possess enhanced
PL and catalytic activity compared to homo-metal
counterparts. Furthermore, alloying effects on structures can
be directly related to their properties at the atomic level,
which further guides researchers to prepare more alloy
nanoclusters with novel geometrical/electronic structures as
well as desirable properties. Consequently, the enhanced
properties endow alloy nanoclusters with potentials in many
applications, such as catalysis, chemical sensing, bio-imaging,
and so on.
Several perspectives are discussed herein.
1. Development of new alloying methods for novel alloy
nanoclusters. Different synthetic methods have displayed

their uniqueness in doping processes. For instance, Pt- and
Pd-doped nanoclusters can only be prepared by the in-situ
synthetic method;63,204,258,262,435 and the Ir doping in
Au25(SR)18 is only accomplished via the inter-nanocluster
reaction method;173 the metal-exchange method provides a
facile approach for meticulously controlling the metal
compositions of alloy nanoclusters.174 The driving force of
metal replacement (galvanic replacement, GR) in bulk metals
is attributed to the difference in electrochemical
potentials,5,645 however, when the size of nanoparticles is
below 3 nm (nanoclusters), anti-GR (AGR) reactions may
occur.80,186 Although many types of atoms have been used to
prepare alloy nanoclusters, most of them are from groups 912, and introducing other types of atoms (e.g., Fe, Mn, Co, W)
remains challenging. Thus, new methods are still needed to
prepare novel alloy nanoclusters.

2. Ligand-effected control over the composition of alloy
nanoclusters. While there has been much work on the
exploration of ligands (e.g., o-/m-/p-Me-Ph-SH for size
control of homometal nanoclusters), their effects on alloy
nanocluster composition remains elusive. Experimentally, it
was found that the reduction of Au/Cu-SC2H4Ph precursors
resulted in Au25-xCux(SC2H4Ph)18 containing up to 4 Cu atoms
only,67 but selenolate-protected Au25(SePh)18 was found to be
able to accommodate up to 9 Cu, and the resulting bimetallic
nanoclusters
are
also
more
stable
than
Au2568 In another case, all Ag heteroatoms are on
xCux(SC2H4Ph)18.
the icosahedral kernel’s surface in Au25-xAgx(SC2H4Ph)18
nanoclusters,66 while in the case of cyclic hexanethiolate
protection, heavy-doping led to Ag atoms on the staple
motifs of Au25-xAgx(SC6H11)18 (x ~19) in addition to the kernel’s
surface.179 These ligand-induced alterations in doping modes
would help in completing the mechanisms for doped
nanoclusters.
3. There is much room for improvement via alloyingtriggered structural transformation. Although Au23(SR)16 can
be subject to slight-doping without changing the structure,
upon higher doping, the nanocluster undergoes
transformations to form Au19Cd2(SR)16, Au20Cd4(SH)(SR)19,
and Au25-xAgx(SR)18 of different structures. Based on
precursors of different Au:Ag ratios, a correlated series of
Au21(SR)15, Au20Ag1(SR)15, Au19Ag3(SR)15, and Au23-xAgx(SR)15 (x
>4) of different structures can be obtained.279 The starting
homo-gold nanoclusters which do not have electronic shellclosing configurations might be responsible for the structural
transformations, providing great potentials to achieve novel
structures.
4. Asymmetric doping or alloying as a new “dimension”.
The preferences of heteroatom(s) in templates are
symmetry-related, and for alloy nanoclusters of specific
magic sizes, distributions of different atoms are
corresponding to the structural symmetries as well. Under
such circumstances, asymmetrically alloyed nanoclusters, e.g.,
Au16Ag1(SR)13, Au20Ag1(SR)15, Au19Ag4(SR)15, Au20Cd4(SH)(SR)19,
become very informative, and their mechanisms require
further elucidation via both experiment and calculation.
Besides, asymmetric alloying generally results in more
distorted structures, bringing about anisotropic properties to
the nanoclusters which could be important but have not been
discussed yet.
5. Shifting the “transition region” from plasmonic (or
metallic) to non-metallic for nanoclusters by alloying. To date,
the largest Au nanocluster with structure elucidation is
Au279(SR)84,418,419 and a sharp transition from plasmonic to
molecular state occurs between Au246(SR)80 and
Au279(SR)84.419 On the other hand, the “transition region” of
Ag nanoclusters moves to much smaller sizes.427 Thus,
alloying is expected to alter the boundary between metallic
and non-metallic states. Alloy nanoclusters with large sizes,
Au130-xAgx(SR)50 and Au52Cu72(SR)55, still show non-metallic
properties,552,646 although Ag or Cu atoms outnumber Au in
these cases. Whether Au144(SR)60 is metallic or non-metallic is
still controversial based on femtosecond time-resolved

transient absorption spectroscopy.647,648 Upon doping, Au144406 while that of
xAgx(SR)60 shows non-metallic optical peaks,
413
Au144-xCux(SR)60 is plasmon-like. Therefore, doping/alloying
on nanoclusters of large sizes is worth studying in the future.
6. Supplementary methods in addition to SC-XRD for more
precise site-determination of heteroatoms. The alloying sites
of different atoms in nanoclusters are of great significance for
investigating the alloying mechanisms. The structural
determination based on SC-XRD is the most precise way to
identify the alloying sites no matter for template doping or
for specific multi-metallic structures. However, due to the
close atomic numbers and similar electron densities, SC-XRD
can hardly distinguish Au from Pt/Hg, or Ag from Pd/Cd. Thus,
other approaches are required; for example, EXAFS can be a
useful approach and was demonstrated to identify the
location of Pt in Pt1Au24.215 NMR may also helpful in
elucidating the alloying positions. New approaches remain to
be developed.176 A multi-approach analysis should be
established for more precise determination of challenging
cases of alloy nanoclusters at the atomic level.
7. Seeing the doping evolution process at the atomic-level.
From crystal structures of mono-metallic nanoclusters and
their doping counterparts, one can only gain the information
of the final doping sites. However, the precise doping process
remains a mystery. As to the mono- and central doping of Au
in Ag25(SR)18,69 Bakr et al. proposed that the introduced Au+
was first reduced to Au(0), replacing one Ag on the
icosahedral kernel shell, and then the Au(0) diffused to the
center due to thermodynamic favorability.69 Xie and
coworkers further demonstrated this Au-doping process on
the basis of alloying Ag25(MHA)18 into Au1Ag24(MHA)18.436
Future work is still necessary to provide more intuitive
perspectives in many other doping processes. In-situ EXAFS
may also provide precise information on this.
8. Applications of alloy nanoclusters. Alloy nanoclusters
often display enhanced chemical/physical properties relative
to their mono-metallic counterparts. As ongoing
improvement is being done in terms of controlling over
structures and compositions of nanoclusters, one future
direction is to move on to precise tailoring of their properties
for applications in various fields. For example, as some of the
nanoclusters have been reported to have extraordinarily long
(e.g. microsecond) carrier lifetimes,274 promising applications
such as 1O2 generation, solar energy conversion, and
photocatalysis can be expected.
On the whole, it is clear that alloying in atomically precise
nanoclusters holds great potential in tailoring the material
properties and achieving deep understanding of many
fundamental issues, such as the alloying sites, evolution, and
structure-property correlation. With the development of
atomically precise nanocluster chemistry, the alloying
strategies will open new opportunities for controlling the
structure, properties, and applications of nanocluster
materials.

Exciting metallurgical breakthroughs of the last decades alongside the development and wideranging availability of new and more capable experimental and theoretical tools for metals research demonstrate that we are witnessing the dawn of a new age in metals design. Historically,
the discovery of new metallic materials has enabled the vast majority of the key engineering
advances in human history. Current engineering challenges create an urgent need for new metallic materials to further our technological advances in multiple industries that are key to our
existence. Yet, present data on metals processing clearly demonstrate the significant environmental impact of the metallurgical industry on our planet’s future. There are numerous reports in
which this impact and corresponding processing solutions are discussed. On the other hand,
design of new metallic materials with improved property combinations can help address key
environmental challenges in various ways. To this end, the goal of this review is to discuss the
most urgent sustainability challenges that can be addressed with alloy design, to help orchestrate
the increasing interest in metallurgical research to focus on these most critical challenges.

1. Introduction: Sustainability by alloy design
The global use of metals is increasing [1], which results in an increased burden from their production, underscoring the urgency
in addressing metals sustainability. Increases in demand for metal have contributed to sharp rises in greenhouse gas emissions,
acidification, aquatic ecotoxicity, and emissions of smog-forming substances [2]. A complete examination of this topic requires
consideration of multiple dimensions of sustainability including, for example, the social impacts of extraction on local communities,
the environmental burdens and benefits offered by innovative design and resource use, as well as the economic implications of
materials substitution. Such a comprehensive look at each of these measures of sustainability across the entire range of the metallic
materials space is carried out on specific metals elsewhere and falls outside the scope of this review [3]. Here our goal is to highlight
the most important opportunities for providing environmental sustainability solutions for different metal families, through alloy

design activities.
As we consider the sustainability of metals, we must recall that it is the services these materials offer within the products they are
contained that is of interest to producers, manufacturers and users, rather than the materials themselves. The key consequence of this
is that a sustainability perspective on these materials requires a life cycle perspective; we must consider not only impacts of ore
extraction and metal processing, but also the impact of the products in use and how that varies as a result of the alloy used, as well as
end-of-life considerations. This life cycle opportunity for alloy design induced sustainability is well referenced through each metal
family below. For example, alloy design can increase thermodynamic efficiency by enabling higher operating temperatures, which
enables reduction of mass in moving parts, or lead to products with higher functionality towards alternate energy generation. Another
quintessential example of this life cycle consideration that will be mentioned in the Al and Mg sections is the use of these metals, in
particular, to reduce vehicle mass. In this case, one finds an increased environmental burden upon production of Al and Mg alloys
compared with steel sheet (around three and four times the energy burden, respectively [4–6]). However, the reduced mass results in
a higher fuel economy due to a lighter weight vehicle in use, meaning that as the vehicle is driven, this increased production burden is
offset. Recent work concluded that this “breakeven distance” (where fuel economy savings outweigh increased product burden in the
form of greenhouse gas emissions) may be between 75k and 200k kilometers for Al and 125k to 325k kilometers for Mg (the distance
is longer for Mg because of the GHG intensive nature of the production process) [7]. Of course, as high-strength steels are designed,
developed, and used, they also provide opportunities to reduce mass (perhaps offering both strength and ductility, rather than
improving one at the expense of the other), and this tradeoff increases in complexity. Given the significant environmental impact of
the transportation industry mentioned throughout the text below, the design of effective alloys that also consider the life cycle
implications offers significant opportunity in moving towards more sustainable product systems.
While the overall use of metals globally is increasing, for metals with toxicity concerns, such as Cd, and to some extent Pb,
consumption has declined (or stabilized in the face of overall growth) over time [8]. However, these metals may be produced as byproducts of mining ore for metals that are the basis of this review so their supply does not necessarily decrease with decreasing
demand [9]. Metals account for 10% of global materials extraction, with steel having biggest impact by volume and, therefore,
overall impact reduction can only be expected as a result of radical changes in technology and/or society for these materials [10].
This could include either the development of novel low-carbon production through electrochemical processing of steel, or a significantly larger share of secondary production. Primary production of metals presently uses 7–8% of global energy consumption, and
with ore grade decline, this energy consumption may increase. The energy impact throughout the life cycle is driven by the energy
used to extract, process, and distribute metallic materials as well as the energy to power metal-containing products in use. Each of
these energy burdens translates directly to increases in metrics such as global warming potential. Direct emissions can also be
significant, for example in production of CO2 from reduction processes occurring in steel and magnesium production. Impacts of
mining also include threatening human health, landscape devastation, habitat demise, generation of significant mine wastes, water
consumption, decreased water quality (for example, aquatic toxicity from copper), and ecosystem pollution – often in ecologically
sensitive areas. The majority of impact during our use of materials originates from fuel and electricity needed to power machines
including transportation, the built environment, or electronics, for example. Corrosion of metals during use may lead to release into
the environment.
On a per kilogram basis, metals with the highest environmental impact are those used predominately as trace elements in alloys
such as precious metals, Sc, Re, or Ge because of the unit mining and processing effort. When we instead consider the global annual
production, Fe, Al, and Cu contribute the most to metrics such as global warming potential or ecosystem damage. For Cu, Zn, Re, and
Mo, the mining process itself can contribute to upwards of 50% of the energy demand or global warming potential, while for most
other metals refining and beneficiation contribute most to upstream impact [3].
Another ongoing concern related to alloy sustainability relates to the trend in increased diversity in the elements used in alloys as
is illustrated below in superalloys and generally found across all advanced technologies [11]. While this elemental complexity offers
significant benefits in improved properties, there is typically a tradeoff around the ability to recover individual elements at end-of-life
and the number of supply chains accessed to produce these alloys. Generally, recovery becomes challenging as alloys become more
mixed, as materials recovery is easier for pure streams [12]. For metals, recycling is limited by the thermodynamics of processing, the
compatibility of elements in extractive processes (Table 1), and the infrastructure through which recovery will occur. Understanding
the implications of design decisions in alloy development is critical to understanding the potential for recovery [13]. In addition,
there may be particular challenges when considering metal recovery from compositionally complex alloys (CCAs), as moving away
from base metal makes the choice of extractive recycling technology non-obvious [14].
Another topic of much discussion around metals and sustainability is the issue of resource availability and materials criticality
[15]. The concern stems from the trend mentioned in the previous paragraph; as we have become increasingly dependent on a broad
representation of the periodic table in our materials design, therefore, availability of these elements becomes a pressing concern [16].
The supply chains for particular elements may be geographically concentrated in regions of political instability or production may
become dependent on one or two countries’ supply of a particular element (Fig. 1). Historic and current examples are found in the
cases of Co [17] and rare earth metals [18]. Furthermore, many of the trace elements critical to advanced alloys and energy technologies are mined as byproducts of major metals, where typical market dynamics of increased price driving further supply may not
be apparent [19].
There are opportunities for increased sustainability or resource efficiency within extraction processing of metals that are largely
outside the scope of design but deserve brief mention. Manufacturing efficiency is often coupled with cost reduction; however,
despite this correlation with economic savings, there is still room to improve. For example, in steel there is 25% loss (Fig. 2), and in Al
a 40% loss in manufacturing [20]. Yield losses along the supply chain for these metals require the production of more metal upstream

than ends up in the final product [21]. As briefly mentioned in the case of titanium below, there may be process efficiencies possible
in more additive approaches to part manufacture [22], and alloy development will continue to play a role in enabling these innovations, for example in the case of functionally graded materials.
Finally, perhaps the largest opportunity for increased materials efficiency arises from design of alloys that enable lifetime extension because of the significant role of alloys in physical infrastructure. Alloy development that extends service lifetime through
improved durability and reliability, including efforts to reduce defects that compromise mechanical properties over time, lead directly to this extension. Furthermore, higher fidelity models for life prediction can result in more efficient use of materials to the end
of their lifetime. Opportunities also manifest in alloys that are amenable to in situ repair or more effectively facilitate reuse. These
have been shown to offer the biggest gains in sustainability of metals as they offset some need for further primary extraction beyond

what is possible through increased durability based on maintenance and reuse of existing products. Improving the reuse of steel, in
particular, presents significant sustainability opportunity because of its ubiquity and lower relative savings upon recycling compared
with aluminum. The absence of impurities or defects within metal products in use has been cited as a barrier to reuse along with the
economics of implementation, both aspects that could be addressed through alloy design [23].
Below, the most critical challenges and opportunities for promoting sustainability in a range of alloy systems are presented.
Through this review, the goal is to highlight the most promising opportunities moving forward, taking into consideration environmental, political, and economic repercussions. In addition, current efforts in these directions are highlighted and open questions are
discussed.

2.1.1. Sustainability challenges
Iron is the fourth most abundant element in Earth’s crust, and by alloying it with small amounts of other abundant elements (C,
Mn, Si, Al) an enormous range of property combinations that can be achieved. As a result, steels are by far the most commonly used
structural alloys: worldwide, steel production reached 1808 million tons in 2018 [24], which is more than all other metal production
combined. Steels form the basis of the infrastructure of our most critical industries, from construction to automotive, packaging and
energy. However, as a result, steel production and use also create the strongest impact on environment [20]. Thus, compared to all
possible metals related environment solutions discussed here and elsewhere, the largest sustainability benefits can be achieved by
through the changes in the practice of making and using steel. Broadly, this can be achieved in two ways: (i) by developing technologies and processes that reduce environmental impact during production; or (ii) by designing and employing steel grades that lead
to sustainability benefits during use. Tremendous amounts of research and development are focused on the former, e.g., to increase
production efficiency [25,26], to increase the recycling efficiency [27,28], to reduce CO2 emissions [25,29], etc. The importance of
such processing solutions is immense, and their impact has already been seen in waste energy recovery [26,30], carbon capture and
storage [31,32], and alternative production [25,33] strategies. The emphasis in this alloy design focused review, however, will be on
the latter, to address the question: What are the alloy design opportunities for steel-dominant applications that could generate the
most significant positive effects on the environment?
Present challenges and opportunities are different for different industries. Currently roughly 56% of the global steel production is
used in the construction industry (42% in buildings, 14% in various infrastructure), 16% is used for the manufacturing of metals
products (12% for metal goods, 3% for domestic appliances, and 1% for consumer packaging), 16% on industrial equipment (13% for
mechanical equipment and 3% for electrical equipment) and 12% for transportation industry (9% cars and light trucks, 3% trucks and
ships) [34]. Evidently, these industries face widely differing and ever-increasing steel performance improvement requirements. With
increasing environmental challenges (and corresponding regulations), sustainability considerations need to be simultaneously taken
into account during the exploration of the large design space of steels. It could be summarized that the corresponding design efforts
need to aim for steels that do more, with less, for longer. Here, “doing more”, refers to those advances in steel design that enable better
property combinations to be achieved. Clearly, if the properties of a given alloy can be improved, less of it can be used to fulfill the
requirements of an application. However, we refer here “with less” to also those design efforts that reduce overall alloying content (or
content of scarce alloying elements), or cause a reduction in alloy density. “For longer”, on the other hand, refers to design efforts that
increase the longevity of steels during use. The following section on alloy-design solutions is categorized accordingly to discuss the
activities that correspond to each of these goals.
2.1.2. Alloy design solutions
One of the most well-known efforts to get steels to do more, is the automotive industry-driven design efforts to simultaneously
improve strength and ductility. The increase in ductility is required to be able to form more complex parts, and the increase in
strength is motivated by the possibility of using thinner gauge sheets in body-in-white, which would lead to weight-reduction.
However, the increase in one leads to the decrease in the other, due to the strength-ductility paradigm. Also, high yield strength is
disadvantageous from the perspective of the energy requirements during forming, and energy absorption during crack propagation.
These conflicting motivations led to the development of several automotive steel grades generally referred to as advanced high
strength steels (AHSS). First generation AHSS include ferrite – martensite dual phase steels (DP) [35]. DP steels exhibit continuous
yielding, high initial strain hardening rate, and, high formability. Second generation AHSS utilize metastable austenite phase to
achieve improved formability. Transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) steels [36], twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) steels [37]
or TRIP/TWIP steels [38], enable pushing strength-ductility combinations further [38] through mechanically-induced martensitic
transformation and twinning mechanisms. Yet, increased alloying costs (especially for TWIP steels, which require > 15% Mn), limit
their application. Development of third generation AHSS, medium-Mn steels [39], TRIP-maraging steels [40], and especially quench
& partitioning steels [41], require use of less alloying and result in better strength-ductility combinations. However, the use of these
superior performance grades is not common.
The common challenge in all AHSS generations is damage-susceptibility, which arises from the presence of multiple phases with
different mechanical characters. Fortunately, even within their current composition ranges, thermo-mechanical processing (TMP)
windows for these steels are sufficiently wide. For example, there have been further investigations [42] on DP steels, especially to
improve damage-resistance during forming (e.g., bending [43], multi-axial deformation [44,45]) or service (e.g., during crash [46],
4

J.L. Cann, et al.

in presence of hydrogen [47]). Variations in TMP can modify transformation-induced geometrically necessary dislocations [48,49],
interstitial carbon [50], martensite plasticity [51,52], and mesoscale microstructure heterogeneities (e.g. bands [53], decarburized
surfaces), all of which influence strain partitioning and localization tendencies, as well as the damage resulting thereof. Similar
opportunities exist for the damage-resistance of more recent, metastability-assisted AHSS’s, although there have been considerably
fewer investigations [54–56]. Major experimental challenges arise here due to the metastable nature of these microstructures, the
high strain levels that need to be applied to trigger damage micro-mechanisms, and the stress-state dependence of damage. These
requirements call for in-situ techniques [57,58] that can reveal microstructure and damage evolution all the way to fracture, at high
resolution, in different strain paths. A clear demonstration of the importance of damage mechanisms in AHSS is seen in cut-edge
failure, which has been a growing challenge for the automotive industry [59,60]. Related with this, plasticity models that can capture
tendencies for strain localization are also not fully developed [61,62]. If developed, these models could guide the design process.
Alternatively, steel design efforts can aim to maintain performance while making do with less material. Current struggles to
increase the remanufacturing and reuse of steels, demonstrate that in future alloy design efforts, significant attention should be paid
to the design decision that influence reusability. In fact, only a small fraction of structural metals end up being reused [63,64]. To
identify pathways to improve, Cooper and Allwood have classified the reuse options into categories: relocate (i.e. if the component is
in good condition, reusing in another project after a limited amount of refurbishment), cascade (i.e. if the component is not in good
condition, and the demand is low, using the component in a less demanding application), reform (i.e. if reuse is followed by a forming
operation), and remanufacture (i.e. if a full refurbishment treatment is applied) [64]. They note that the greatest constraint on the
reuse of components arises from compatibility issues, which are limiting reuse in sectors that use large amounts of metallic materials,
such as transportation, infrastructure, mechanical equipment, domestic appliances, etc. [63,64]. Other constraints can be due to
alloying. For example, it is shown that the increasing copper concentration levels of steel scrap requires virgin material addition and
limits the recycling rate [65]. Nevertheless, the reforming route has been successfully adopted by at least one major industry: the
shipbreaking industry. Bangladesh has the world’s leading shipbreaking industry and directs up to 70% of the scrap metal from
decommissioned ships to re-rolling mills for rebar production, avoiding any re-melting process [64,66] (which also increases feasibility [67]). In comparison, shipbreakers in the US mainly export their scrap to melting shops in neighboring countries [68].
Another critical reuse opportunity, is regarding the use of the present gas pipeline network in a potential transition to a hydrogen
economy [69–71]. Other important examples of the minimization strategy include light-weighting by reducing alloy density or by
reducing modulus. In steels, density reduction has been investigated heavily in the last decade through aluminum alloying [72] in socalled TRIPlex steels [73] (Fig. 3). These steels benefit from the kappa-carbide precipitation, as well as the mechanically-induced
transformation of metastable austenite. Upon optimal TMP, new deformation micro-mechanisms can be activated in this alloy system
to overcome the strength-ductility paradigm [73,74]. On the other hand, modulus reduction has been investigated mainly by exploring metal matrix composite structures [75], due to the relatively limited effects of alloying on steel elastic modulus.
Significant environmental benefits can be generated by designing steels that go longer. Cases of early component failures create
significant challenges for the infrastructure, industrial equipment and automotive sectors especially. In the last two decades, research
activities to address early component failures have led to numerous new steels with exceptional failure-resistance (although the rate
at which such new materials are transferred to industrial use is alarmingly slow). For example, superior wear resistance is achieved by
carbide-free nano-bainitic steels [76,77], enhanced fatigue-resistance is achieved by nanolaminated reverted austenite steels [78],
and research on hexagonal closed packed (hcp) ε-martensite-containing FeMnCoCr alloys demonstrates that this phase can exhibitHEresistance, demonstrating significant ductility even under 100 MPa pressure hydrogen gas [79]. These three failure modes and
corresponding activities are discussed in detail below.
The impact of wear on steel component lifetime is significant. Wear occurs in a wide range of in-service environments, which
causes large variations in the activated mechanisms. To a first approximation, hardness has been used as an important parameter for

Fig. 3. Ultimate tensile strength (MPa) versus elongation (%) of high manganese TWIP or TRIPlex steels. Reproduced from [72].

wear [80]; Brinell hardness is commonly used to categorize the wear resistance of steels [81]. However, other mechanical properties
such as work hardening, fracture toughness, and ductility are also known to affect the wear resistance, as wear processes can include
crack growth mechanisms such as delamination and microcutting [82,83]. In this regard, the role of austenite — soft but work
hardenable — is of significant importance for the wear resistance of AHSS. A recent study compared five steel grades (martensitic
steel, DP steel, QP steel, TWIP steel, and IF steel) and shows that TWIP steel has the best wear resistance for a multi-pass, dualindenter scratch test due to the significant work hardenability of the sub-surface during the pre-deformation [82]. Another representative example is retained austenite in nanostructured carbide-free bainite [76,77]. Under dry rolling/sliding conditions, the
retained austenite work hardens the surface through the phase transformation to fine and hard martensite and contributes to the
superior wear resistance.
Typical engineering strategies to avoid fatigue failures involve using large safety factors in component design or application of
surface hardening treatments. Alloy or microstructure design efforts focused towards fatigue resistance are relatively rare, despite
potential reductions in metals use or processing complexity and increases in component lifetime. This is partially due to the sensitivity of the corresponding damage mechanisms to a large variety of boundary conditions. In bearing steels, for example, the applied
stress level influences the activated damage mechanisms [84], which causes some concern for accelerated rolling-contact fatigue
tests. In Cr-Mo steels that exhibit fatigue failure in superlong life regime, a second factor, namely hydrogen trapping by inclusions,
becomes critical [85,86]. Unraveling such mechanisms and their dependence on composition and processing (to guide future alloy or
microstructure design efforts), requires extensive experimental investigations. Through the development of physics-based computational tools some of these challenges are overcome by enabling accelerated exploration of different concepts. McDowell and Dunne,
for example, focus on crack nucleation and propose microstructure refinement and strengthening, as well as barrier-spacing reduction
and -strength increase [87]. One way to reduce barrier spacing is to introduce nanolaminates. A nanolaminated medium manganese
steel with exceptional fatigue resistance was developed [78] by combining the benefits of (1) nanolaminated multiphase morphology
and (2) metastable austenite enabling the TRIP effect. The multi-phase nanolaminate morphology enhances the roughness-induced
crack termination mechanism (especially in high stress amplitude-low cycle fatigue), and the metastable austenite transforms to
martensite triggering the transformation-induced crack termination mechanism (especially in low stress amplitude-high cycle fatigue).
HE has been one of the main issues faced by AHSS for several decades, as the susceptibility of HE is proportional to the strength of
steels [47,88,89]. Although numerous HE mechanisms [90,91] (e.g. hydrogen-enhanced and strain-induced vacancies, hydrogenenhanced decohesion (HEDE) and hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity (HELP)) have been extensively studied, the fundamental
understanding of HE is still under debate. In particular, most AHSS such as DP steel consists of multiple phases, and hence multiple
mechanisms operate in a cooperative manner [47], which makes the analysis and the solution more complex. Recently, the introduction of austenite nano-films has been suggested as a potential solution for HE of martensitic steels [92,93]. The main proposed
reasons are 1) the austenite surrounding the martensite can act as trapping sites of hydrogen [94]; and 2) the introduced austenite
nano-films interact with the propagating macro-cracks, contributing to plastic deformation and damage resistance [92]. In this case,
unlike in the case of fatigue crack resistance, the TRIP effect of the austenite film may decrease the HE resistance, as the final
microstructure becomes α’ martensite with high HE susceptibility. On the other hand, a recent study reported that a FeMnCoCr high
entropy alloy has superior HE-resistance even with thermally-induced and deformation-induced hcp ε-martensite [79]. The HE
resistance is expected to originate from the unique plasticity of the high-entropy ε-martensite in this alloy [95,96]. Thus, further
investigation is needed to reveal the effects of the metastability, size, shape, and distribution of austenite on HE in AHSS.
As this summary reveals, more investigations are needed on developing steel that go longer, particularly due the complexity of
damage and fracture mechanisms. Fortunately, the reviewed alloy design solutions for wear, fatigue, and embrittlement have some
similarities, i.e., in structural refinement and introduction of thin film austenite. The latter, especially, when designed carefully with
the aid of advanced characterization and computing tools [97,98] can be a potential remedy for damage-susceptibility of AHSS.
2.2. Aluminum alloys
2.2.1. Sustainability challenges
The transportation industry was responsible for 14% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2010, due to combustion of fossil fuels
(gasoline and diesel) in engines of road, rail, air, and marine vehicles [99]. One effective approach to make vehicles more fuelefficient is to decrease their mass by replacing high-density steel with much lower density, high-strength aluminum alloys in
structural, load-bearing parts used at ambient temperature [100]. Another approach is to use aluminum to replace much heavier
alloys in parts operating at high temperature, i.e., cast-iron (e.g., in brake rotors), steel (e.g., near, and in, car engines) or titanium
(e.g., near jet engines in airplanes [101]). Increasing the use temperature of aluminum could also provide significant efficiency boosts
for electrical cables (replacing copper in car wires and steel in long-distance power-transmission cables [102]) and for brazed heatexchangers or heat-sinks (replacing copper [103]). Currently, commercially-available aluminum alloys are however limited, under
load-bearing conditions, to temperatures of ~220 °C; above this temperature, strengthening precipitates undergo dissolution, phase
transformation and/or rapid coarsening, resulting in a loss of strength and of creep- and sag-resistance [101].
The following section describes the ongoing development of L12 based aluminum alloys, tailored for high-temperature applications, with drastically increased usage temperatures. Over the last two decades, the effects of more than 20 alloying elements, either
added separately or jointly, have been investigated to produce the highest precipitation strengthening, exhibiting coarsening resistance, while the material cost is kept low. The most optimized alloys can achieve operating temperatures up to 400–450 °C.
Successful replacement of heavier alloys in the transportation industry would most certainly lead to a drastic decrease in fuel

consumption, thus reducing the ecological impact of vehicles.
Producing the needed aluminum of course also has an environmental effect. However, between 1995 and 2010, the energy used in
primary production and the amount of greenhouse gases emitted per mass of aluminum produced in the United States were reduced
by 26% and 37%, respectively [104]. In addition, aluminum production can be made much more efficient by recycling, with 92%
energy savings [104], greatly increasing its sustainability.
2.2.2. Alloy design solutions
To achieve high creep resistance at temperatures much higher than ~220 °C in castable, heat-treatable aluminum alloys, one can
take inspiration from Ni-based superalloys, which are creep-resistant for thousands of hours at temperatures exceeding 75% of their
absolute melting temperature Tm. This outstanding creep- and aging resistance is achieved primarily by L12-ordered γ-Ni3(Al,Ti)
precipitates which are coherent with the face-centered cubic (fcc), γ-Ni-rich matrix, impede dislocation motion at ambient and
elevated temperature, and show slow coarsening kinetics. Such Al-based superalloys, with aging- and creep resistance up to 425 °C
(0.75∙Tm), can similarly be developed by precipitating a high number density of shear-, coarsening- and dissolution-resistant L12
nano-precipitates, which are thermodynamically stable in, and coherent with, the aluminum matrix, and which coarsen slowly by
diffusion [101]. Because aluminum, unlike nickel, shows low solid solubility for all L12-precipitate-forming solutes (< 0.25 at.%),
only low volume fraction of precipitates can be achieved (0.2–0.5%) in castable alloys. However, the lattice mismatch of the coherent
L12 nano-precipitates (up to 4–5%) combined with their very high number density (1022–1023 m−3) and small radii (2–5 nm) provide
for significant precipitation strengthening for extended times at temperatures as high as 400 °C.
Several slow-diffusing transition elements (M) form Al3M (L12) nano-precipitates when precipitated from a supersaturated aluminum solid-solution [101], the most widely studied and least dense element being scandium [105–115]. For example, a small
addition of 0.18 at.% Sc can increase the ambient temperature microhardness of pure aluminum from 200 MPa to 800 MPa
[116,117]. The diffusivity of Sc in Al is high enough to achieve peak hardness upon aging for a few hours at 300–350 °C achieving
Al3Sc (L12) precipitate size optimal for creep resistance, but it is low enough that Al-Sc alloys are coarsening sluggishly up to
~300 °C; thus, these alloys are creep- and coarsening resistant up to that temperature [116,117].
To achieve higher use temperatures, zirconium can be used instead of scandium, as the diffusivity of Zr in Al in about three orders
of magnitude lower than that of Sc [101] and as Al3Zr (L12) nano-precipitates, despite their metastability, exhibit a much higher
coarsening resistance than Al3Sc (L12) nano-precipitates. However, Al-Zr-based alloys usually requires > 100 h of aging to achieve
peak microhardness [118–123] and the number density of the metastable Al3Zr (L12) nano-precipitates is also generally low; thus, the
strengthening effect of Zr is smaller than that of Sc. By contrast, Er has a larger diffusivity than Sc [101,124], and thus Al3Er (L12)
nano-precipitates nucleate and grow at lower temperatures and Al-Er alloys suffer from an earlier strength loss [125]. This fast
coarsening prevents the use of Al-Er alloys for long-term structural applications above ~250 °C. The (L12) Al3Er lattice parameter is
larger than Al3Sc or Al3Zr, however, thus producing a larger mismatch between the coherent Al3Er nano-precipitates and the Almatrix (4%), which is beneficial to creep resistance [126].
The addition of Zr or Er to Al-Sc alloys results in ternary Al-Sc-Zr and Al-Sc-Er alloys with improved coarsening- and creep
resistance, respectively. Aging of Al-Sc-Zr alloys induce the formation of coherent core-shell Al3(Sc,Zr) (L12) nano-precipitates, which
provide good creep resistance [111,127–131]. The Sc-rich core forms during the early stages of aging and these nuclei serve as
heterogeneous sites for precipitation of Zr, which form a Zr-rich shell protective against Ostwald ripening. Similarly, in Al-Sc-Er
alloys, Er atoms form nuclei onto which the Sc atoms precipitate, forming an Er-rich core surrounded by a Sc-rich shell [132,133]
which slows coarsening of the coherent Al3(Sc,Er) (L12) nano-precipitates. The creep resistance of Al-Sc base alloy is drastically
improved by very small (< 0.01 at.%) Er additions due to the formation of a Er-rich core which increase the lattice parameter of the
nano-precipitates [133]. Beside Er, other rare-earth elements (RE = Y, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Tm, Yb or Lu) can be added to binary AlSc alloys [132–134]. Due to their faster diffusivity as compared to Sc, these RE are all enriched in the core of the Al3(Sc,RE) nanoprecipitates, whose increased lattice parameter mismatch drastically increase creep strength of the alloys at 300 °C.
Quaternary Al-Sc-Zr-Er alloys cumulate advantages of the ternary Al-Sc-Zr and Al-Sc-Er alloys [135]: (i) Er induces the nucleation
of an increased number density of nano-precipitates and increases their lattice parameter mismatch, and (ii) Zr improves the
coarsening resistance of the nano-precipitates, thereby improving high-temperature stability of the alloy. For example, only 30 min at
400 °C was needed for the quaternary Al-0.05Sc-0.01Er-0.06Zr (at.%) alloy to achieve a microhardness plateau of ~450 MPa [135]
and this hardness was stable for > 6 months at 400 °C. Due to the difference in the diffusivities of Er, Sc and Zr (DEr > DSc > DZr),
the L12 nano-precipitates display a core-shell-shell structure, with an Er-enriched core, a Sc-enriched inner shell and a Zr-enriched
outer shell [135].
Research on inoculant micro-additions to further increase the strength of the L12 strengthened-Al alloys has focused on silicon
[136–138], which has the advantage of being a natural impurity in commercial-purity aluminum. Si can accelerate diffusion of
metallic solute (M) in Al by forming M-Si-V clusters (where V is a vacancy), which diffuse faster than isolated M atoms in the fcc-Al
matrix. Nucleation, growth and coarsening kinetics of nano-precipitates are thus accelerated [139]. The M-Si-V clusters also serve as
nuclei for heterogeneous precipitation, increasing number density and volume fraction of nano-precipitates, and thus strengthening
the alloy [137,138]. The enhanced solute diffusivity induced by silicon has, however, the drawback of increasing coarsening kinetic
of the nano-precipitates [138]. Also, instead of the typical core-shell-shell nanostructure observed in Al-Sc-Zr-Er alloy, the nanoprecipitates in a Si-modified alloy exhibit a single core enriched with Sc, Er and Si (with Si located on the Al-sublattice) surrounded
by a Zr-enriched shell [137,138]. Other post-transition metal inoculants (i.e., Zn, Ge, In, Sn, Sb) increase the number density of
Al3(Sc,Zr) nano-precipitate [140–142] and are usually found in the shell of these nano-precipitates, alongside Zr. Antimony-modified
alloys show improved coarsening resistance, while In- and Ge-modified alloy have higher creep resistance [140–142].

Due to the scarcity and high cost of Sc, researchers have sought to replace Sc. Er, which is cheaper but still presents a significant
materials availability risk, is now used in Al-Er-Zr [143,144] and Al-Er-Zr-Si [145] alloys, with increasing concentrations of Er (up to
0.04 at.%) and Zr (up to 0.1 at.%). As for Al-Sc alloys, binary Al-Er alloys, when alloyed with Zr, show a reduced coarsening rate of
their Al3(Er,Zr) nano-precipitates due to the formation of a Zr-enriched shell [143,144]. These Sc-free Al-Zr(-Er) based alloys however
require extended aging duration to reach peak hardness, typically > 60 h at 400 °C. Due to the sluggish diffusivity of Zr, the Al3Er
nano-precipitates undergo early coarsening before the Zr-shell forms. Addition of Si to these Al-Er-Zr alloys is however expected to
accelerate the precipitation kinetic to some extent, as observed is the similar Al-Yb-Zr-Si alloys [146]. Alloys with high amounts of Er
also usually suffer from significant grain refinement due to primary precipitation of Al3Er, which reduce the creep resistance of the
alloy.
Scandium thus still remains a key element in the development of high-temperature aluminum alloys. Reducing Sc additions to
values as low as 100–200 at.ppm [147,148] allows to address the drawbacks encountered in the Al-Er-Zr alloys (i.e., early coarsening
of the Al3Er nuclei and slow precipitation kinetic of Al3(Zr,Er)), while minimizing the cost of the alloy. A recently developed low-Sc,
high-Zr alloy (Al-0.08Zr-0.014Sc-0.008Er-0.10Si, at.%) achieved a similar peak microhardness (~575 MPa) as a previous Sc-rich
alloy (with ~0.06 Sc), while showing good coarsening resistance at high temperatures) and only needing 24 h to reach peak hardness.
Additionally, compared to the hundreds of hours needed for Sc-free Al-Zr-based alloys to reach peak microhardness, the above Zr-rich
alloy only needs 24 h when aged in the 375–425 °C range. Fig. 4 displays a LEAP tomographic datasets collected for the above Al0.08Zr-0.014Sc-0.008Er-0.10Si alloy aged at 375 °C for an extended duration of 21 days: a nearly stoichiometric Al3Zr shell, which
provides coarsening resistance, envelops a Sc- and Er-enriched core (Fig. 4d), which provides increased lattice mismatch and thus
creep resistance [147,148]. The creep resistance of this alloy at 300 °C is comparable to an Al-0.08Sc (at.%) binary alloy.
Attempts have been made to drive the maximum operating temperature of aluminum superalloys beyond 400 °C by adding L12forming elements with diffusivities lower than Zr, i.e., Ti, Hf, V, Nb and Ta, to slow coarsening by forming another protective shell
around the Zr-rich shell of nano-precipitates present in Al-Sc-Zr-based alloys [149–151]. Aside from Ti, which homogeneously distributes in the Al3Zr precipitates [152], Hf, V and Nb are indeed found to segregate to the outer shell of the Al3M precipitates;
however, this does not translate into higher coarsening- or creep resistance of the alloys. In fact, Ti additions negatively impact the
creep resistance of the alloys due to the lower lattice parameter of the Al3(Zr,Ti) precipitates [153]. The heavy segregation of Hf to

the dendritic structure of a Al-0.11Zr-0.045Er-0.08Hf-xSi-yFe (at.%) alloy [151] leads to an oversaturation in solute, preventing
homogenization of Er. Although the alloy achieved significant precipitation strengthening, it needed > 200 h to reach peak microhardness values. Lastly, addition of 0.05–0.08 at.% V, Nb or Ta to a Al-0.07Zr-0.02Sc-0.005Er-0.06Si (at.%) alloy improved only
slightly the coarsening resistance of the nano-precipitates [149,150]. These micro-additions also increased the peak microhardness
values achieved during a double-aging heat-treatment (up to 600 MPa when Ta was added) but had either no impact on the creep
resistance of the alloy (for V and Nb), or negatively affected it (for Ta), due to a reduction in precipitate lattice mismatch. Further
improvements in high-temperature strength can be achieved via solid-solution strengthening, e.g., with Mn [154–156], Mg [157,158]
or Li [159,160] and via oxide dispersoids [161].
Another path towards the development of high-temperature aluminum alloys focusses on using α-Al(Fe,Mn)Si precipitates which
are slow-coarsening up to 400 °C [162–165]. However, because Fe, Mn and Si are eutectic elements in aluminum, these α-precipitates
are concentrated in the interdendritic channels, leaving the dendrite cores non-strengthened. By replacing Mn with the peritectic
element Mo (whose diffusion coefficient in Al at 400 °C is ~200 times lower than Zr [101]), a homogeneous distribution of bodycentered cubic (bcc) α-Al-(Fe,Mo)-Si precipitates, coherent with fcc-Al and with excellent coarsening resistance, was achieved in
Al–6.8Si–0.21Cu–0.34 Mg-0.09Mo alloy (at.%); the alloy showed good creep resistance at 300 °C [166]. Further addition of
0.07–0.25 at.% Mn resulted in a higher volume fraction of the α-precipitates and improved creep resistance at 300 and 350 °C [167].
To form this phase in a reasonable time span, a heat-treatment at high temperature (540 °C) was necessary.
De Luca et al. investigated dual L12- and α-precipitation strengthening by Mn and Mo microadditions to an Al-Zr-Sc-Er-Si alloy
[168]. In addition to the solid-solution strengthening induced by Mn and Mo, the interaction of these two elements with the L12
nanoprecipitates increased their number density and coarsening resistance, respectively. This unexpected interaction was evidenced
by APT, which revealed the presence of Mn in the core of the nanoprecipitates and the slow diffuser Mo in the shell. Upon aging past
peak hardness at 400–450 °C, the subsequent precipitation of α-AlMnSi platelets further strengthened the alloy (Fig. 5). Additionally,
the consumption of Si dissolved in the matrix to form α-AlMnSi precipitates prevents the accelerating effect of this element on the
coarsening kinetics of the L12 nanoprecipitates during overaging. Overall, the Mn- and Mo-modified alloys displayed increased hightemperature stability, peak hardness values, and drastically increased creep resistance at no significant increased cost or decreased
processability [169].
While the family of L12-strengthened aluminum alloys have been widely studied for high-temperature applications, further development is needed to optimize α-Al(Mn,Mo)Si strengthening, notably the interaction with other elements which can affect nucleation, precipitation and coarsening of this phase and, ultimately, further strengthen the alloy. For example, it was found that Cd
micro-addition creates homogeneously distributed nano-precipitates which act as nucleation sites for α-AlMnSi, and significantly
increase the alloys strength [170]. The dual use of L12 precipitates and a second populations of coarsening resistant precipitates, such
as the α-phase (as described above) or eutectically-formed Al3Ni [171–173] or Al11Ce3 [174–176], is key to new castable, heattreatable aluminum alloys with extreme temperature resistance above 400 °C.
2.3. Titanium alloys
2.3.1. Sustainability challenges
As the ninth most abundant element, titanium is rich as a natural resource, and the major challenge is to convert the TiO2 ore into
titanium metal in an energy efficient way. The classical Kroll process [177] is still dominant today, although many attempts were
made, especially in the last twenty years, to devise less energy demanding extraction processes (e.g., the FFC process [178]). The
products of these new processes are normally powders of pure titanium or titanium with one or several metals that are present in the
starting ore, and these processes promise huge potential cost reduction, especially when combined with the emerging technology of
additive manufacturing. Electron beam cold hearth melting [179] technology enables scrap to be used increasingly as a measure to
reduce the cost of raw materials in titanium alloy production. A further advantage of this melting technology is that it may hopefully

replace the traditional multiple vacuum arc remelting process and produce slabs that can be directly rolled, thus reducing the number
of deformation steps.
Alloy design efforts to reduce cost include the use of cheap alloying elements such as Fe to partially replace expensive elements
such as V in the workhorse alloy Ti-6Al-4V, the most successful examples being the development of TIMETAL LCB (Ti-1.5Al-4.5Fe6.8Mo) [180] and SP-700 (Ti-4.5Al-3V-2Fe-2Mo) [181].
The major market of titanium is aerospace, and titanium alloys are used in both airframe structures and engine components. The
increasingly high safety standards mean that the certification process of introducing a new alloy is prohibitively expensive, so
improving existing alloys to help best exploit their application potential is equally important from a sustainability point of view.
Three opportunities in titanium alloy design will be focused on in the remainder of this section, focusing on opportunities in
(α + β) two-phase alloys, near α titanium alloys, and γ-TiAl based alloys, respectively.
Titanium alloys for airframes or other structural applications are normally (α + β) two-phase alloys that need to possess a
combination of high strength and good ductility and toughness. The balance between these conflicting properties can be raised to a
higher level if a hierarchical microstructure [182] is created by manipulating the precipitation of the hexagonal α from the bcc β
phase.
Near α titanium alloys have comparatively good creep resistance at high temperatures and are used to make compressor rotors in
aircraft engines. They, however, may suffer from a substantial reduction in fatigue life if the load is held at its peak value for a short
time instead of continuously cycled. This phenomenon occurs near ambient temperatures, so it is referred to as cold dwell fatigue
[183]. Fatigue crack initiation sites are in the sub-surface region, making inspection and prior detection on a component very
difficult. As a result, compressor disks are designed based on conservative assumptions, and the advantages of titanium alloys have
not been fully exploited.
The intermetallic compound γ-TiAl has one of the highest specific strengths of all metals [184] and the use of this class of low
ductility material to make low pressure turbine blades in mainstream aircraft engines represents a breakthrough in materials engineering. The current working temperature however ranges from 650 °C to 750 °C [185], much below expectation. Developing γTiAl based alloys that work at 800 °C and beyond depends on solving the challenging problems of maintaining microstructural
stability at the service temperatures.
2.3.2. Alloy design solutions
- Two-phase (α + β) alloys
Increasing both strength and good ductility and toughness is a challenge in structural alloys, but by using a hierarchical microstructure and controlling precipitation of α in the β phase, this can be achieved.
High strength titanium alloys normally contain a high volume fraction of the β phase (they are also called β alloys), and the
nanoscale precipitation of α can be stabilised by minimising the transformation strain though alloy design. The β phase is stabilised by
alloying with transition metal elements, and the resulting alloys, depending on the level of alloying additions, may produce a range of
metastable phases including ω [186] and the orthorhombic martensite αjj [187] upon cooling or deformation.
Metastable phases in β titanium alloys can be used to modify transformation paths and boost the nucleation rate of the α phase,
achieving super fine, homogeneous microstructures which cannot be attained otherwise. The ω phase, for example, provides additional driving force for α nucleation by modifying local composition and stress field [188], influences precipitate distribution indirectly during multi-step heat treatment [189], and increases nucleation sites at β/ω interfaces [190]. The (reverse) ω transformation was also reported to facilitate twin nucleation and thus increase the ductility of β titanium alloys [191,192]. Likewise, the α″

martensite (Fig. 6) was shown to significantly increase the α nucleation rate and to drastically improve the ductility of a titanium
alloy wire [193]. A variety of metastable phases based on α″ were reported recently, for example the O′ [194] and O″ [195] phases.
The α″ as a martensite is formed from the β by a {1 1 2̄} 1 1 1 shear followed by a {0 1 1} 0 1̄ 1 shuffle. The shear causes

2 a . For O′, only the shuffle is present, so 2 aO = bO = cO = 2 a holds. The O″ is a superstructure of O′ and has a

unit cell three times as large. These metastable phase transformations can be exploited to manipulate the (α + β) microstructure, to
achieve high strength while maintaining an acceptable level of ductility and toughness.
With suitable alloying additions, the αjj martensitic transformation can be stress induced, and the obtained alloys (such as the
GUM metal [196] and Ti-24Nb-4Zr-8Sn [197]) exhibit superelasticity, high strength, great ductility, low modulus, invar and elinvar
effect. These properties may lead to applications in biomedical implants and the tire wires of lunar rover wheels. Recent investigations [198,199] suggest that nanoscale concentration modulation and αjj martensitic nanodomains or embryos may exist in
these alloys giving rise to peculiar stress-strain behaviour.
- Near α alloys
The root cause of the cold dwell behaviour in near α titanium alloys appears to be the highly anisotropic slip characteristics of the
hexagonal α phase. In the hard orientation (applied stress is perpendicular to the basal plane), both prismatic and basal slip cannot
operate. If by chance a neighbouring grain is in a soft orientation, the stress built up at the grain boundary causes a shear stress in the
hard grain; the slip band may evolve into the nucleus of a fatigue crack under applied cyclic tensile stress (Fig. 7). Alloy type (α
volume fraction), microstructure, microtexture and load condition were shown to be the major factors that influence the dwell effect
in titanium alloys [200–202]. An interesting contrast is between two engine alloys differing only in Mo content, Ti-6242 (Ti-6Al-2Sn4Zr-2Mo) and Ti6246; the former is dwell sensitive while the latter is not. Recent investigations [203,204] attributed the difference to
the role of Mo, which is both a strong β stabiliser (thus it decreases the β transus temperature) and a slow diffuser (it reduces the α
grain size and thus the mean free path of dislocation slip and promotes more uniform deformation). The effect of Mo trapping
vacancies and thus limiting creep relaxation was found insignificant. There have been intensive efforts to model stress redistribution
from the soft grain into the hard grain (termed ‘load shedding’ [205]) using both crystal plasticity finite element [206] and discrete
dislocation plasticity [207] approaches. The aim is to evaluate the effects of all these complex factors in conjunction with sophisticated experimental characterisation of microtexture and local grain orientations and to predict crack initiation in these important
titanium alloys. A full understanding of the evolution of deformation microstructure of near-α alloys by a combination of modelling
and experimental approaches will provide a sound basis for devising a deformation path that may completely eliminate microtexture
and dwell fatigue problems.
- γ-TiAl alloys
The outstanding specific strength of γ titanium aluminides compared to other intermetallics derives from a unique lamellar
microstructure consisting of about 85% γ-TiAl and 15% α2- Ti3Al. To withstand higher application temperatures, alloying with high
contents of Nb is necessary. Such alloying promotes the high temperature β (or its ordered form B2) phase. As in the case of high
strength titanium alloys, the β phase is prone to metastable phase transformations, producing detrimental phases [208], which must
be controlled before high-Nb TiAl alloys can be used in critical components. It has been shown that Zr promotes the formation of ω in
TiAl [209,210], while Mo was shown by both experiment [211] and computation [212] to suppress ω formation. The orthorhombic
Ti2AlNb (O phase [213]), an ordered version of the αjj phase as shown in Fig. 6, was also recently observed to form in a high-Nb TiAl
alloy [214].
In the case of high strength titanium alloys, the metastable phases form in an intermediate temperature range and can normally be
avoided at ambient temperatures at which the structures bear load. In high-Nb TiAl the metastable phases form in the temperature
range of intended application [208] and thus pose a great challenge. Future alloy design efforts should seek to either eliminate the

metastable phases or limit their size and optimise their distribution. Computation and modelling may play a key role in identifying
alloying combinations that best fulfill this task.
2.4. Magnesium alloys
2.4.1. Sustainability challenges
Magnesium has the lowest density of all structural metals at 2.7 gcm−3. There is currently a large scientific and industrial interest
in the use of magnesium in the transportation sector to reduce vehicle mass with the goal of decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. For
example, a 10% reduction in an automotive vehicle weight results in a 7% decrease in vehicle emissions [215]. Significant recent
success stories include the changes in certification to allow magnesium seats in airplanes [216], the use of magnesium sheet roof
panel by Porsche [217], and a magnesium die cast liftgate produced by Meridian Lightweight Technologies for Fiat Chrysler [218].
Joost and Krajewski have recently reviewed some of the challenges that magnesium faces for high volume applications such as the
automotive sector with one of the conclusions being that “there is substantial opportunity for innovation in alloying, processing, and
integration of magnesium,” while emphasizing that cost of the material and throughout the process is paramount in this sector [215].
When thinking about sustainability, it is important to take a holistic view on the use of magnesium, and recent work has emphasized the importance of taking a life cycle analysis to the environment impact of magnesium utilization, in particular, the production of greenhouse gases. As an example of this process, life cycle assessment guidelines have been published by the Canadian
Standards Association (CSA) for auto parts [219]. Fig. 8, taken from the 2013 DLR study published by the International Magnesium
Association [220] shows the importance of the life cycle analysis. It compares the generation of carbon dioxide during production,
use, and end of life for a number of different magnesium production technologies (e.g. variants of Pidgeon process and electrolysis)
compared to aluminum as a baseline. Noting that the vast majority of magnesium is currently produced by the Pidgeon process, one
can see that the CO2 savings during the use of the vehicle only breaks even with the CO2 produced during production, which is not
very attractive from a global perspective. On the other hand, if magnesium can be produced using green electricity, the CO2 savings
accumulate from the very beginning of the use phase. An additional important point is that the recycling infrastructure for magnesium is immature (what does exist is mostly within a single company), which is also an impediment to magnesium having a more
positive effect on sustainability. Further, the corrosion of magnesium alloys and strategies to mitigate their intrinsic poor corrosion
behavior are of critical importance to the question of sustainability (however, corrosion is outside the scope of this short review, the
reader is referred to the recent extensive literature review from Esmaily and co-workers [221]).
The reality is that Mg is much less mature as a structural material compared to the Al and steel alloys that it may replace. Many
aspects of its behavior are complicated considerably by its low symmetry HCP crystal structure, which requires deeper understanding.
This represents an interesting opportunity as it opens the door for new rapid alloy development strategies and is an excellent case
study for the application of an integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) approach. In the following, the state of the art
12

for alloy development of cast and wrought structural magnesium alloys will be reviewed, progressing from basic thermodynamic
knowledge, to solidification, thermomechanical processing (including the important topic of crystallographic texture) and plastic
deformation mechanisms (including deformation twinning).
2.4.2. Alloy design solutions
There has been important progress made in the past 10 years on databases for fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic data for
magnesium alloys. This information has been widely disseminated and is available commercially from FACTSage [222] or Pandat
[223]. These CALPHAD tools are increasingly becoming reliable for ternary and higher order alloy systems providing, for example,
access to phase diagrams for alloy designers. Diffusion coefficient data has also been accumulated, using both experimental combinatorial approaches [223] and first principles calculations using density functional theory (DFT) to obtain activation energies [224]
(both parallel and perpendicular to the basal plane), again offering important input for the development of computational tools used
in alloy and microstructure development.
Casting of magnesium alloys is important as either the final step (e.g. die casting) or as an input for the processing of wrought
products [225]. The use of advanced characterization techniques such as x-ray synchrotron tomography [226,227] and phase field
models [228,229] have resulted in important contributions to understanding the as-cast microstructure in 3D. Further, low cost
processing routes to produce magnesium sheet have focused on twin roll casting; see, for example, references [230,231]. In terms of
die casting, the recent ICME study from researchers at Ford has emphasized using computational tools to understand the development
of local properties within the casting [232].
Turning to the production of wrought products (extrusions, sheet and forgings), a tremendous amount of work has focused on the
effect of alloy additions on basic deformation modes and the development of recrystallization textures. Here, the effect of rare earth
additions has been shown to be highly beneficial both for increasing the activity of < c + a > slip to help accommodate arbitrary
plastic shape changes and to modifying the typical “basal” sheet texture (i.e. c-axis of unit cell perpendicular to the sheet plane). For
example, Skszek and co-workers showed a complex, production prototype door inner could be warm formed (at temperatures of
200–250 °C) at conventional stamping speeds using a ZEK100 alloy (0.25 wt Nd was the rate earth addition) [233]. The forming
behavior of ZEK 100 was characterized by Worswick and co-workers [234] who showed its much superior behavior to conventional
sheet alloys such as AZ31B.
The work of Sandlöbes and co-workers emphasized that the ductility (to improve formability and in-service behavior) of magnesium could be enhanced by the addition of yttrium [235,236] due to yttrium’s effect to make < c + a > pyramidal slip easier.
There have been very detailed calculations by Curtin and co-workers to rationalize how yttrium and other rare earth additions modify
pyramidal slip [237]. This fundamental work has led to new computational approaches to guide the development of new alloys with a
good combination of strength and ductility. Curtin et al. have done a series of calculations on the effect of alloy additions on the
fundamental properties of < c + a > dislocations in Mg-X, Mg-Al-X, Mg-Zn-X alloys with the results shown in Fig. 9 [238]. Here, the
results suggest alloying strategies that involve rare earths, Ca, and Mn, or combinations with Zn and Al. On the other hand, Sandlöbes
and co-workers have used a very novel “Yttrium Similarity Index” [239] to computationally examine over 2850 ternary alloys
looking for promising new candidates. After applying a series of cost design filters (see Fig. 10), the authors were able to recommend
a rare earth free Mg-1Al-0.1Ca (wt.%) alloy, which they subsequently fabricated and found has promising mechanical properties. This
represents an entirely new and very promising approach to guide alloy development and shows how computational tools can greatly
reduce the traditional trial and error approach.
There has been recent progress on the question of how rare earth additions (and potentially other alloy additions) affect the
development of deformation and recrystallization textures. For deformation at the grain level, Martin et al. have shown that the
heterogeneity of deformation at room temperature is reduced in a Mg-Zn-Nd alloy as compared to AZ31b, with this being attributed
to the relatively easy operation of non-basal < c + a > slip in the rare earth containing alloy [240,241]. Recently, Nayyeri et al. have
shown that instrumented spherical indentation with indenters of different radii can be used to extract information on how alloy
additions affect basal and < c + a > slip [242–244]. Orozco-Caballero et al. also recently conducted a high resolution digital image
correlation study to quantify the local operation of various slip systems (and twin modes), which accommodate the different strain
incompatibility between neighboring grains [245]. The role of twinning and its accommodation is of critical importance to understanding polycrystal plasticity. Barnett has recently made progress in understanding how deformation twins can propagate using the
finite element method [246]. These studies point to the complexity of deformation in polycrystal magnesium and highlight some of
the challenges in modelling this behavior.
In the case of recrystallization and the effect of rare earth and similar alloy additions (e.g. Y and Ca), this starts with first principle
calculations using DFT where it is has been shown that the binding energy of rare earth elements (and yttrium) is much stronger than
other elements [247]. Zhu et al. confirmed with high resolution transmission electron microscope studies that Gd segregates to
various tilt boundaries while Robson showed similar but weaker effects for Y [248]. Further, Barrett and co-workers have used a
combination of molecular dynamics simulations and EBSD studies to rationalize how the growth of different texture components
during recrystallization changes the final texture [249,250], while Imandoust et al. [251,252] have reviewed the experimental
literature and attempted to rationalize the various results. Guan and co-workers have recently done very detailed experimental
studies to examine how the different texture components evolve during recrystallization [253,254], while Robson et al. have pointed
to significant effects of the strain path on recrystallization [255]. In summary, considerable progress has been made in understanding
the role of various alloy additions on recrystallization, but a predictive framework for these effects remains elusive.
Another area that has received considerable attention is precipitation hardening of magnesium alloys. It is generally observed that
the increment of strengthening in Mg alloys is less effective than in aluminum alloys since the precipitates that form have a lower

number density and are coarser. Nevertheless, the group of Hono and co-workers have made significant progress in designing extrusion [256] and sheet alloys [257,258], which are precipitation strengthened through a combination of alloy additions that strain
compensate (larger and smaller atoms) to help promote nucleation [259]. They have shown that improved combinations of strength
and ductility can be found in rare earth free Mg-Al-Mn-Ca alloys.
In summary, it can be seen that while considerable progress has been made in recent years, the complexity of deformation, the
effect of alloy additions on fundamental deformation, and recrystallization mechanisms leads to a rich range of behavior. However,
new promising computational techniques combined with advanced characterization techniques are providing new strategies to account for this complexity.
2.5. Superalloys
2.5.1. Sustainability challenges
Superalloys as a class of materials have, for decades, underpinned the advances in the performance of turbine engines for both
aircraft and power generation [260,261]. Metallic materials typically constitute 85–95% of the weight of an aircraft engine [262],
with nickel-base superalloys as the major class of materials, Fig. 11. Nickel alloys are employed (i) as wrought polycrystalline
materials in disks and combustors, (ii) as cast polycrystals in low-pressure turbine blades and in structural cases and frames and (iii)
as single crystals or columnar-grained directionally solidified crystals in high-pressure turbine blades. Over the next 20 years it is
projected that > 38,000 new aircraft will be produced [261]. Performance and sustainability are influenced by many facets of the
extraction, production and recycling of the suite of major alloying elements in nickel base alloys, including Al, Cr, Co, Mo, Nb, Ti, Ta,
W and Re.
As the operating temperatures have continued to rise in the hottest section of the engine (the high-pressure turbine) to improve
fuel efficiency, the melting points of the nickel alloys employed in turbine blades have become a fundamental barrier. This motivates

the development of new classes of higher melting point materials, which include SiC-SiC composites [263], refractory intermetalliccontaining alloys [264,265], refractory “high entropy” alloys [266], and cobalt-base γ – γ′ alloys [267–270]. While SiC-SiC composites and Mo- and Nb-based alloys promise higher temperature capabilities, they suffer from poor oxidation resistance as well as
extremely challenging and expensive processing paths.
2.5.2. Alloy design solutions
The L12 Co3(Al,W) intermetallic phase that is the basis for this new class of Co-base alloys was only discovered in 2006 [267].
However, it was immediately recognized as a potentially promising basis for new superalloys [268] due to the fact that it precipitates
in a morphologically identical manner to Ni3Al in nickel-base superalloys and provides a high level of strengthening, Fig. 12. A major
challenge for the design of this class of alloys is the extraordinarily large search space, considering that most superalloys contain 6–10
major alloying elements, plus, often, small quantities of minor elements such as C, B and Hf. Given that Co3(Al,W) is a true ternary
intermetallic not extending to any of the constituent binary systems, the starting point for this new class of alloys was the Co-Al-W
ternary. Interestingly, around the same time that this system emerged as promising, computational power had increased to the point
where new suites of computational tools for alloy design were enabled, and initiatives that aimed to integrate these new computational tools with data-driven approaches and new experimental tools to accelerate the design and implementation of new materials
also emerged [271–273]. Thus, it is worth considering how such new tools have altered the search for new materials within this class,
departing from conventional statistical “design of experiments” approaches that have been employed for decades.
Essential attributes of a new superalloy for use in components in single crystal form include (1) a high melting point and high
elastic modulus; (2) a high fraction of thermo-dynamically stable L12 precipitates that persist to above 1100 °C; (3) a high resistance
to creep, which will be strongly influenced by the chemistry and morphological arrangement of the L12 precipitates as well as the
interdiffusion behavior; (4) resistance to cyclic fatigue, which will sensitively depend on precipitate properties as well as the initial
structure of the single crystals following solidification; (5) thermodynamic and kinetic properties that permit single crystal solidification at moderate thermal gradients.
From the perspective of thermodynamics and alloying, CALPHAD-type tools have long been under development and have been
successfully deployed for Ni-base superalloy design in compositional domains where phase equilibria and intermetallic compounds
are well mapped out for all relevant ternary systems in the domain of interest [274–276]. Thermodynamically compatible intermetallic bond coatings for nickel-base alloys have also been designed with initial compositional ranges guided by CALPHAD-type
tools [277]. Given that the ternary Co3(Al,W) phase was not present in any of the commercially available thermodynamic databases,
and considering the time required to assess all the relevant ternary and quaternary systems, CALPHAD tools were not initially useful.
Early high temperature deformation experiments on ternary and quaternary Co-base alloys revealed some unexpected deformation modes, as shown in Fig. 12. In ternary and quaternary alloys containing Co (but no Ni) high densities of faults are observed
in the precipitates (Fig. 12c) after creep deformation at 900 °C. These result from extensive shearing of the γ′ phase in Co-base alloys
from the earliest stages of creep deformation [278]. The shearing process results in the formation of SISFs (superlattice intrinsic
stacking faults) and SESFs (superlattice extrinsic stacking faults) by a process involving the reaction of two unit matrix dislocations at
the γ-γ′interface that form a a/3〈1 1 2〉 super-Shockley partial dislocation, which shears the precipitate while leaving a second a/
6〈1 1 2〉 partial dislocation at the precipitate-matrix interface [278,279]. Under similar creep strain conditions in Ni-base alloys, the
precipitates are sheared by pairs of antiphase boundary (APB)-coupled a/2〈1 1 0〉 dislocations [280]. More recently in Co-Ni compositions, SISF loops surrounded by APBs have also been observed [281]. Interestingly, segregation of constituent elements to the
SISF faults has also recently been observed for both Ni-base and Co-base alloys, giving a new chemical design parameter to consider
[282,283]. All of these observations point to a strategy of maximizing fault energies, in order to increase the shearing resistance of
precipitates, which in turn, will positively benefit both monotonic and cyclic properties (yield strength, fatigue, creep resistance).
With recent expansions in computational power, DFT is now an effective tool for guiding the search for useful alloying elements in
this scenario where fault energies are critical. DFT calculations [284] have been employed to calculate the relative thermodynamic
stability of the L12 phase and the SISF fault energy (both proportional to the energetic difference between the ordered fcc and hcp

effect, Ta and Ti (with a spread in energy depending on site occupancy) do indeed provide the highest level of elevated temperature
strengthening observed to date [270,278,285]. Experimentally measured changes in the γ′ solvus with additions of the various d
block transition metals, Fig. 13b, also move in the higher temperature direction along with increases the SISF energy, again suggesting Ta, Ti and Nb as the most beneficial alloying elements. The addition of some Ni is also useful for increasing the solvus
temperature [286]; thus, the alloy design space quickly expands to a seven element system: Co-Al-W-Ti-Ta-Nb-Ni. Interestingly, Re
additions, which are highly beneficial for nickel base alloys [260–262], are destabilizing for the L12 phase in the Co-base system. This
is a positive result, considering the limited global supply of Re, which has recently risen to as much as $10,000/kg and may constitute
up to 6 wt.% of advanced single crystal Ni-base superalloys.
The 0 K DFT calculations that guided the exploration toward the seven element domain were conducted over a much shorter time
period (< 1 year) compared to that required for development of the thermodynamic database, and thus were more useful in guiding
early exploration. Recently, Nyshadham et al., in a systematic DFT search for new ternary systems forming stable L12-precipitates,
predicted two new Co-based systems (Co-Ta-V and Co-Nb-V) with stable γ + γ′ structure [287]. Experiments showed that the
predicted γ′ Co3(Al,V) and Co3(Nb,V) phases were indeed formed on aging but that they were metastable [288]. Stable γ + γ′
structures were achieved by further additions of Ni, Al, Ti and Cr, thus creating W-free Co-based superalloys with good creep
resistance [289] Other W-free γ + γ′ superalloys have been discovered empirically, with researchers replacing the high-density W
with a combination of lower-density elements such as Ta, Ti, Nb, Mo, Cr, and V [290–296]. The first family of W-free Co-based
superalloys with a γ + γ′-microstructure was introduced in 2015 by Makineni et al. [290,297,298] and is based on Co-10Al-5Mo2Nb/Ta.
With respect to the CALPHAD databases, the ternary Co-Al-W system was assessed by Cui et al. in 2011 [299] and the quaternary
Co-Al-W-Ni quaternary in 2014 [300]. The first reports of alloys designed with guidance of CALPHAD tools have only recently
appeared [301,302]. DFT-based finite temperature calculations1, conducted via the Clusters Assisted Statistical Mechanics (CASM)
approach2 [303], show that the SISF energy will increase with temperature with Nb and Ta additions, while the energy of the Ticontaining material remains relatively unchanged with temperature up to 1100 °C [303], providing further information on fault
energies relevant to the operating temperature required for these materials. While it has been suggested that the L12 phase is not truly
thermodynamically stable in the Co-Al-W ternary [304,305], finite temperature calculations demonstrate that the vibrational entropy
can stabilize the L12 phase at around 600 °C in the ternary system [306]. Nevertheless, DFT-based approaches quickly become
intractable as the design space expands beyond the quaternary. Thus, a combined DFT-CALPHAD strategy is ultimately still necessary
and will greatly enhance the exploration of the design space intermediate to the new Co-base alloys and the already-assessed Ni-base
alloys.
Other emerging computational and experimental design tools have guided the exploration for suitable alloy compositions.
Solidification models that predict the onset of convective instabilities and corresponding single crystal growth experiments have
demonstrated that this class of materials is ideal for large, complex single crystal components, due to favorable segregation tendencies of elements during solidification [307]. High throughput tools have guided the search for improved oxidation resistance
[308]; an ion plasma based deposition approach [309] has been used for the production of compositional libraries that have been
subsequently screened for formation of a-Al2O3 during oxidation using high throughput photostimulated luminescence spectroscopy
(PSLS) screening [310]. Mechanics codes that assess the driving forces for failure in multilayered systems [311] have shown that
bond coating and thermal barrier systems developed for Ni-base alloys will perform well on a subset of Co-base alloys investigated to
date that possess coefficients of thermal expansion that are similar to Ni-base alloys. Interdiffusion databases, currently under development [304,312], will aid the design of coatings as well as homogenization heat treatments. Models for predicting flow stress and
the development of microstructure along wrought processing paths for these materials remain to be developed. In aggregate these
design tools, while not fully integrated, enable a much more directed search for promising alloying additions and far fewer experiments than would occur in previous alloy design exercises.
Finally, the performance of superalloy components in service and their retirement at end of life are also important considerations
for sustainability. As with many multiphase metallic engineering materials, models for mechanical properties, which inevitably
depend on complex dislocation glide and climb processes and interactions of these defects with microstructure, are the least welldeveloped. Continued development of constitutive models for material behavior that acknowledge mechanisms across length scales
as well as degradation mechanisms that occur in service will be essential. Combining these predictive capabilities with sensors and
new digital twin approaches [313] promises tremendous future improvements in reliability and sustainability.

2.6. Shape memory alloys
2.6.1. Sustainability challenges
Shape memory and superelastic alloys, the canonical example of which is NiTi, are of potential interest for more efficient, “smart”
devices. Two examples are perhaps most prominent: actuation and calorics. In the actuation example, the alloys are heated (or, in a
ferromagnetic shape memory alloy, operated using a magnetic field), such that a component such as a flap, vane or door is moved.
This allows mechanically simpler, lower mass actuation to be achieved, providing opportunities for, e.g. tailoring of jet engine
geometries for different stages of the flight cycle. This would allow for fuel efficiency improvements of several percent in each of a
number of applications. For over a decade now, Noebe et. al. at Boeing/NASA have been working on high temperature SMAs [314]
for the ~80 °C application to noise-reducing chevrons at the rear of the engine bypass duct. In the second example, what is sought is
not the shape change, but rather the heat of transformation as a means of producing a heat pump for space heating, refrigeration or
air conditioning.
Air conditioning accounts for 2020 TWh of annual energy use, or 10% of all electricity consumed, 3% of primary energy demand –
the equivalent of the entire aviation and shipping sectors [315]. In the pursuit of efficiency, the key metric for heat pumps (e.g.
refrigerators) is the ‘coefficient of performance’ (COP), which is the ratio of the electrical energy spent to move heat from the fluid
being heated to the fluid being cooled. Best-in-class external air to domestic hot water heat pumps today have a COP of 2.3, whereas
ground source heat pumps for underfloor heating systems can have COPs as high as 3.5. The problem is that, if the marginal energy
used is produced by thermal combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plants at ~494 gCO2e kWh−1, then the gains against a ~90%
efficiency domestic gas boiler (213 gCO2e kWh−1) are marginal - the breakpoint is at a COP of ~2.3. However, heat pump designs
have been proposed that replace the vapour compression cycle with caloric materials, with theoretical COPs of 6–10 being proposed
[316–319], although real-world COPs in devices are usually found to be as low as 50% of theoretical values.
One concern would be that the total electrical demand from dwellings might then be so large that unfeasible levels of winter-only,
low utilisation power generation would be required. Using the UK grid as an example, heating demand can be reduced from current
peak demand of 59 GW [320] down to a more manageable 12 GW via a combination of insulation (from 36.7 to 14 W m−2 @20 K DT)
and COP = 4 heat pumps. With a 15-year replacement cycle then this gives a UK market size of ~10 GWth yr−1. The amount of
caloric material required can therefore be estimated; assuming an operation frequency in the region of 12.5 Hz, this implies heat
pump sizes of around 500 J/cycle, and with heat capacities in the region of 400–500 J kg−1 K−1 [319,321] and temperature changes
associated with transformation of 7–20 K, caloric material requirements of 100 g per device. This implies a UK market of 150 t yr−1,
or a global market (including refrigeration, etc.) on the order of 6 kt yr−1. The leading elastocaloric candidates, NiTi [322] and
CuZnAl, can be produced by conventional melt processing, even in powder form, at these scales and the total quantities are not at all
challenging relative to current resource production rates of the parent elements, and so from a resource efficiency perspective these
are plausible candidate solutions. Other SMAs such as Ni-Mn based fSMAs, Ni2FeGa or CoNiAl may also be usable [323,324].
In comparison with magneto- and electrocaloric materials, the amounts of energy required are challenging for thin film devices,
which even though they report total transformation energies of 20–40 kJ kg−1, would still require 7.5–110 g of material per device,
fabricated by PVD or similar processes, at a scale of 0.5–7 kt yr−1 [318,319]. This scale is likely to be challenging for e.g. Dy (global
production: 1.3 t oxide/yr) and Gd (3.6 t oxide/yr). However, magnetocaloric and electrocaloric materials (e.g. Peltier coolers)
remain attractive, e.g. for semiconductor and cryogenic applications where device fabrication infrastructure is in place. Electrocaloric
PbTiO3-based materials [318], on the other hand, suffer from no such concerns and therefore are probably the leading competitor to
NiTi and CuZnAl.
Operating at 12.5 Hz and producing ~6000 kWh/yr, a 5 kW heat pump will have a ~14% duty cycle and experience around 0.8

billion cycles over its 15 year lifetime [319]. At present, the lifetime reported in the literature for most shape memory materials,
including NiTi, is only around 104–105 functional cycles, which is around 104 times too low. In, e.g. airplane actuators a component
lifetime of 105 cycles, e.g. for a flap, might be acceptable, given typical aircraft structural lifetimes on the order of 30,000 flight
cycles. Moreover, the transformation temperatures continuously decline over life, so the performance will degrade. Therefore the
fundamental challenge for elastocalorics and for superelastic/shape memory materials is really one of functional lifetime.
2.6.2. Alloy design solutions
- NiTi
NiTi is a cubic B2 intermetallic above its transformation temperature, martensitically transforming to B19 (orthorhombic) or its
sheared variant, which is a B19′ monoclinic structure. NiTi has been used for over 30 years in biomedical devices such as stents, so it
is perhaps a surprise that fundamental questions remain around its use. However, in the biomedical device the material only
transforms to its low temperature shape once – when it is cooled for insertion into the body, and then spends its life in its austenitic
shape. It can be produced either by melting pure elements or directly from the oxide electrochemically [325]. Another challenge is
that the transformation temperatures are strongly sensitive to composition, and particularly interstitial oxygen content, so that the
transformation temperatures of every batch melted must be verified [326]. It should be borne in mind that the width of the B2 phase
field is quite narrow and that intermetallic inclusions, which act as crack initiators, can easily be formed. Even without the presence
of such inclusions, the fatigue threshold of B2 NiTi is around 2 MPa m [327], lower even than that of brittle microstructures such as
γ-TiAl. Engineering with such a material will require care and attention at every stage of design and fabrication.
The main problem both for actuators and elastocalorics is that of functional fatigue [328], where the transformation temperatures
evolve on repeated cycling. So-called training, or pre-cycling prior to service, can mitigate the problem somewhat by first accounting
for the greatest changes that occur over the first few hundred cycles, but there is evidence that changes continue to occur for at least
104–105 cycles. In superelastic materials, the hysteresis loop narrows and transformation stresses also drop over the course of cycling.
Detailed experimental investigations of this phenomenon in the literature are notably lacking, with most investigations focusing on
the first 20 or 100 cycles, but it is understood to be a consequence of the production of interface defects during transformation.
Because the mismatch between the unit cells of the austenite and martensite phases are up to ~10%, the interfacial strain is much
larger than the amount that can be accommodated elastically, and so the interface between the twin-accommodated laths of the
martensite phase is most likely semi-coherent; that is, it contains interface dislocations and disconnections. When the transformation
is reversed, these defects will remain, giving rise to stabilisation in the transformed variants that are produced but also to a back stress
that inhibits subsequent transformation and defers it to larger undercoolings than would be required in a perfect unstrained lattice.
This also explains why there is such a large hysteresis in the first place; it is a consequence of the need to produce interface defects on
formation of the martensite, which are not annihilated on reversion.
Recognising this, and exploiting the phenomenological theory of martensite transformation, a substantial thread of work has
developed which attempts to use alloying to tailor the interface strain, described by the relative volume change upon transformation
[329–333]. Simultaneously such alloying will affect the transformation temperatures. Such tailoring has been demonstrated to
minimise the hysteresis, demonstrating a route to solving the problem. Detailed mathematical development of the theory has also
given rise to the so-called cofactor conditions on the transformation strains. Another route with a longer history has been to use
nanoscale intermetallic precipitates to provide nuclei for martensite precipitation, with the aim of stabilising the transformed variants
that form. This approach also helps with providing consistency in the properties, because if alloys are engineered to be at the phase
boundary then the B2 NiTi composition will be given by the phase boundary rather than being determined by the melting accuracy.
In isolation, this approach met with only limited success, but in combination with tailoring of the misfit, it appears to have enabled
the development of an alloy that does not suffer from functional fatigue, with the transformation stress–strain curve remaining
consistent for > 107 cycles. Therefore, it appears that a route to producing stable actuators is available, both for NiTi alloys
operating on the range of ~50–100 °C and for higher temperature NiTiHf alloys for jet engine actuation. Similar conclusions should
be applicable to elastocaloric applications for heat pumps.
- CuZnAl
Far less is published on CuZnAl [326], and most investigations to date have focused on extrinsic properties rather than investigating phases of microstructures. However, some investigations on its use as an elastocaloric have been published, showing a
cooling of around 6–14 K [334–337], and that it requires relatively low applied stresses of < 60 MPa [338]. One advantage of this
system is that air induction melting and powder production should be quite straightforward. This system would also be far cheaper to
produce and would present even fewer concerns from a resource efficiency perspective. A typical composition would be Cu-17Al14Zn (at.%) [339,340] or Cu-13Zn-9Al [341]. The alloys take on the phase at high temperatures, which is the Im3m cI2 bcc CuZn –
Cu3Al disordered solid solution, and precipitate predominantly the 18R martensite (amongst other long period layered rhombohedral
structures). Austenite finish temperatures tailorable between 41 and 120 °C have been reported; again, trace alloying with Ti, Zr or V
can precipitate fine precipitates of the L21 Cu2AlTi phase, termed the Xs phase, or Cu5Zn8, which can assist with grain refinement and
may provide a route to martensite stabilisation in an analogous way to the NiTi system [342]. However, this appears to strongly affect
the transformation temperatures. There is also a γ brass I 4̄3m cI 52 D82 structure of the Cu5Zn8 – Cu9Al4 solid solution [343], which
can be obtained by ageing below around 400 °C [340]; such ageing should therefore be avoided to produce a B2-based elastocaloric,
19

J.L. Cann, et al.

although again fine scale γ precipitates may be usable for stabilisation [344]. As with NiTi, although it is less mature, elastocaloric
application to heat pumps therefore appears to be plausible. In comparison, resource availability and cost drivers would seem to
favour CuZnAl over NiTi, as do the lower stresses required for actuation.
2.7. High entropy and complex concentrated alloys
2.7.1. Sustainability challenges
Reliance on the 5000 year old alloy development paradigm, in which modification of a dominant base element by relatively small
additions of one or more alloying elements gives an improved balance of properties [345], may no longer be enough. Decades-long,
highly funded international efforts have failed to develop new materials to meet many essential energy and sustainability challenges.
The maximum metal operating temperature for gas turbine superalloys has not increased significantly in the past several decades.
Commercially viable alloys with dramatic improvements in specific strength or stiffness have not been found. The dream of a
transportation industry dominated by electric or fuel cell vehicles remains un-fulfilled. The lack of breakthroughs in all of these areas
suggests that fundamentally new ideas are needed to discover and develop the needed materials.
The high entropy alloy (HEA) concept was launched in 2004 from two papers that shared a single inspiration – that alloy bases
might be devised with multiple principle elements rather a single, dominant element [346,347]. This new idea vastly expands the
number of base systems for the exploration and development of new materials. Although expansive in scope relative to the millenniaold concept of elemental alloy bases, the HEA field has nevertheless evolved in a way that places limits on the core idea. Specifically,
HEAs are restricted to alloys with 5 or more principal elements and are often considered to only include alloys with a single phase,
disordered solid solution microstructure [266]. The concept of complex, concentrated alloys (CCAs) retains the spirit of the core idea
but includes many alloys that are excluded by the HEA field [348]. CCAs include alloys with fewer than 5 principal elements, can
have any number or type of phases (including compounds), and have no implications regarding the magnitude or importance of
entropy.
Since the first such alloys were introduced [349], this approach has produced 151 new alloys drawn from 100 new alloy systems.
New high temperature structural HEAs and CCAs are drawn from 16 elements that include 9 refractory elements for high temperature
strength and 7 other elements that decrease alloy density, form compounds increasing high temperature strength, or improve environmental resistance [350]. New cryogenic HEAs and CCAs have been developed from transition metal elements (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co,
Ni, Cu) and were reported to have extraordinary fracture toughness at cryogenic temperatures compared to conventional alloys
[351,352]. HEAs and CCAs based on low density elements also offer new approaches for energy efficient materials [353–355].
While initial high temperature strengths are encouraging, room temperature ductilities appear to be marginal and may be related
to the bcc structure of the refractory bcc HEAs and CCAs [349]. The room temperature strengths and ductilities of the transition metal
based fcc HEAs and CCAs, however, lie within the regimes of commercialized engineering alloys [351,352].
While at first glance the number of potential alloy systems of interest is enormous, there are many restrictions - technical,
economic, and environmental - that should be considered when selecting which elements to include in HEAs and CCAs. For example,
there are relatively few elements with densities that are sufficiently low to dramatically improve density or specific strength while
retaining damage tolerance, environmental resistance, and manufacturability. Eighteen metallic elements that are not radioactive or
toxic have densities below 6 g cm−3, but only 7 are commercially viable due to cost (Mg, Si, Al, Y, Ti, Se, As). Of these, three are base
elements for conventional low density alloys (Mg, Al, Ti).
Fu et. al. developed a materials selection framework based on an analysis of material price, price volatility, materials availability,
and recyclability for HEAs and CCAs [14]. The analysis was performed through combinatorial investigations of all possible elemental
compositions for hypothetical equimolar alloys. They observe that alloy price increases when the number of elements increases
(Fig. 14a), which can be attributed to the higher probability of including a more expensive element in 5 or 6 component alloys. In
contrast, price volatility actually decreases when the number of elements is increased (Fig. 14b), which is due in part from the
dilution effect of low volatility elements on high volatility elements. As a result, HEAs and CCAs will typically only be pricecompetitive with advanced alloys like Ni, Ti, Co, and refractory metals. However, unlike price, the availability of HEAs and CCAs is
dependent not only on the average availability of each constituent element, but also on the most limiting. By considering the
Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), which accounts for geopolitical supply concentration, the materials availability risk of each
element can be quantified (Fig. 14c). Alloying elements such as Mg, W, and Nb have high HHI values, while Mo and Ti have low HHI
values. The materials availability risk should be considered alongside cost when determining which elements to include in HEAs and
CCAs.
Recycling of HEAs and CCAs presents unique challenges as well as potential opportunities. Interest in recycling traditionally dilute
elements may be increased due to their comparatively high concentrations in HEAs and CCAs, considering the economies of scale.
However, as shown in Table 1, the feasibility of extracting constituent elements through existing recycling processes becomes a
challenge, considering thermodynamic and economic constraints. The most plausible extraction strategies, which utilize copper and
zinc/lead processes, still present barriers as these recycling centers are geographically dispersed, making scrap collection economically if not technically difficult.
Thus, it can be seen that the vast majority of potential HEAs and CCAs are only moderately economical and recyclable. Taking
into consideration the factors mentioned above, the number of practical element combinations is dramatically reduced. Significant
efforts are needed to select economically and environmentally viable alloy combinations that meet today’s technical demands. Even
after applying a suitable materials selection framework to the set of possible alloying elements, there exists a vast number of possible
alloy systems to consider in the design of HEAs and CCAs. Establishment of generic design rules based on the physics-related

parameters is thus essential; examples include solid-solution strengthening in fcc [356] and bcc [357] CCAs and ductility in bcc CCAs
[358].
2.7.2. Alloy design solutions
There are multiple strategies to push the envelope of strength and ductility that can be achieved in metallic materials by exploiting the HEA and CCA concepts. The initial core concepts of HEAs are based on the expectation that a large number of elements or
a large mixing entropy in HEAs will lead not only to high phase stability but also to desired mechanical properties. However, mixing
entropy is no longer regarded as the governing underlying phenomenon, since it does not include information about interactions
among the constituting elements. Instead, new concepts such as lattice distortion [359], which directly relates to the behavior of
defects, are being devised to predict the mechanical properties in a more meaningful way. In these investigations, a consistent
observation is that lattice distortion or strength of HEAs and CCAs can be increased by increasing the difference between certain
properties of constituent elements. An example is the solid-solution strengthening of 3d transition metal based CCAs which originates
from the difference between the electronegativity of elements [356].
Focusing only on a few core properties, however, may cause alloy designers to deviate from the initial motivation of HEAs and
CCAs. It may be more pertinent to refocus by seeking to introduce multiple sources of strengthening or toughening mechanisms,
which helps the effective design of new alloys. In light of this, two promising concepts are apparent: introduction of intermetallic
precipitates and short range ordering (SRO). A recent study on multi-component intermetallic compounds, or so-called ‘high entropy
intermetallic compounds’ showed, for example, that a high entropy superalloy with multicomponent intermetallic nanoparticles has a
superior ductility of ~50% with gigapascal level strength [360]. Typical high-strength superalloys have less than ~20% ductility. The
high entropy superalloy, thus, overcomes the strength-ductility trade-off. The exhibited stabilization of plastic behavior is attributed
to the abnormal ductility of multicomponent (NiCoFe-TiAlFe) intermetallic nanoparticles with an ordered L12 structure. Note that the
precipitation hardening elements do not need to be principal elements, reducing their economic and environmental effect.
Short range order can also provide a route to increasing strength and ductility through what can be considered atomic scale
precipitates. The complex compositional atomic environments in HEAs and CCAs increase the probability of preferred elemental
combinations, often resulting in the formation of SRO. SRO was originally defined by the conventional Warren-Cowley description
[361], which quantifies the deviation of atomic configurations from the fully random distribution. SRO in the Warren-Cowley description has been measured by the diffuse scattering of X-rays, neutrons, and electrons [362,363], or recently by state-of-the-art
21

Progress in Materials Science xxx (xxxx) xxxx

J.L. Cann, et al.

techniques such as STEM [364,365]. Recent descriptions of SRO have expanded to include spatially localized 1–3 nm scale precipitates that are basically on the scale of medium range ordering [366], which can be detected by APT [367]. It was shown that
ordered oxygen complexes can be formed in oxygen doped refractory TiZrHfNb HEA with a bcc crystal structure [367]. Usually,
doping with interstitial elements in bcc refractory alloys decreases the ductility. However, the oxygen doped TiZrHfNb HEA shows an
increase in both strength and ductility. The strong pinning effect of oxygen SRO changes the deformation mechanism from planar slip
to wavy slip, promoting dislocation multiplication for higher strength and ductility. There is increasing evidence that suggests that
SRO can lead to unexpected improvements in mechanical properties by triggering new deformation mechanisms. SRO can thus
provide new paths to improving properties while adding minimal elements for the sustainable alloy design.
New high throughput approaches to explore and characterize HEAs and CCAs are important to progress [368]. Several high
throughput approaches have been performed to investigate phase stability [369–371] and mechanical properties [372] of HEAs. The
approaches include both computational modeling (CALPHAD, DFT) and experimental approaches (combinatorial synthesis, nanoindentation). There are several technical challenges in the current high throughput experimental approaches [373]. One major
challenge is the fabrication of massive samples with controlled microstructures. Current synthesis techniques typically use the thin
film sputtering method, and a compositional gradient is used for the combinatorial synthesis. In order to enable high throughput
approaches at the lab-scale, further work on the translation of traditional material processing and testing methods to small-scale and
massive samples is required.
In accordance with the expansionist philosophy of HEAs and CCAs, another approach is to consider the work in the functional
material community as inspiration for HEA and CCA design, further expanding the possible alloy design space. Many functional
materials are based on compounds that usually have two or three crystal sublattices. Each sublattice is dominated by a particular
principal element, so that these functional materials typically have two or three principal elements. Common examples include Bi2Te3
(thermoelectric), NiTi (shape memory), In2O3 (transparent conducting oxide) and BaTiO3 (piezoelectric). The functional materials
community has already essentially embraced the concept of HEAs and CCAs, since the base is typically a concentrated compound and
complete series of elemental substitutions are often explored on one or more sublattices. As a result, the functional materials
community has produced many HEAs such as the half-Heusler thermoelectric compounds (Hf0.5Zr0.5)Co(Sb0.8Sn0.2),
(Hf0.25Ti0.5Zr0.25)(Co0.95Ni0.05)Sb, and (Hf0.4Ti0.6)(Co0.87Ni0.13)Sb [374]. Functional alloys are typically designed using ideas that are
independent of typical HEA motivations. Entropy is rarely considered, so these functional HEAs are ‘hidden’ and will not be found
using ‘HEA’ or ‘entropy’ in keyword searches. The HEA and CCA community can benefit from a closer inspection of this work, as it
provides a large body of data that can improve our understanding of how concentrated, multi-element substitutions may influence
phase stability and properties. This is especially important regarding the relatively unknown effects in structures with more than one
sublattice.
The functional materials community can also benefit from a further merging of ideas. As in structural alloys, CCA concepts may
vastly increase the number of functional materials for consideration. A casual inspection of the literature suggests that current
functional materials design strategies typically substitute only one atom on a sublattice at a time, so that each sublattice usually has
only one or two elements. In unusual cases, one sublattice may have as many as 3 elements, as in (Co0.95Ni0.05)(Hf0.25Ti0.5Zr0.25)Sb.
However, CCA concepts allow functional materials to be designed with 3 or more elements on one or more of the crystal sublattices,
introducing a large number of new alloys. To illustrate, the alloys above are part of the half-Heusler phases that can be listed as XYZ,
where the X sublattice is occupied by early d-block transition elements such as Hf, Mn, Ti, and/or Zr; Y sites contain late d-block
transition metals such as Au, Co, Fe, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Rh, and/or Ru; and Z sites are filled by p-block basic metals or semi-metals such as
Bi, Ga, Sb, and/or Sn [375]. Nearly 2000 alloy systems are provided by placing 3 or 4 of the candidate elements on each of the three
sublattices in half Heusler compounds. This is a general approach. For example, full Heusler phases can be represented as (Fe,Mn,V)
(Co,Cu,Fe,Ni,Pd)2(Al,Ga,Ge,In,Sb,Si,Sn) and skudderudite compounds can be listed as (Co,Fe,Ni)(As,P,Sb)3. It is clear that a vast
number of new functional materials can be produced by intermingling 3 or more elements on one or more sublattices in compounds
such as these.
The functional materials community could also benefit by considering the role configurational entropy may play in stabilizing
crystal structure. The Cantor alloy, CoCrFeMnNi, is a single phase disordered solid solution with an fcc crystal structure above 600 °C,
even though the constituent elements have 3 different crystal structures at 600 °C (Fig. 15a). Similar results are found in high entropy
compounds; the first documented example [376] considers an equimolar mixture of five different metal oxides with three crystal
structures to produce a single phase oxide (Fig. 15b). Configurational entropy is an important consideration in retaining this single
phase. These results show that the structure of a base compound can be retained even when adding high concentrations of elements
that do not form the same structure. Many functional materials are electronic compounds, which appear to limit the number of
candidate atoms. However, it has not yet been considered whether configurational entropy may be sufficient to overcome electronic
effects in some cases. Computations that consider both electronic structure and configurational entropy may provide insights into
whether or not even more options might be available for alloying functional material compounds.
3. Summary
We have highlighted the most promising opportunities for the use of alloy design as a sustainable tool from the perspective of
seven different alloy systems, and a summary is given in Table 2. These opportunities vary from reducing quantities of required
materials through property improvement or extension of functional lifetimes to increasing stability at high temperatures, allowing for
improvements in efficiency. These opportunities call for the use of both environmentally-conscious alloying element selection and
computationally-informed material design to achieve crucial properties.

J.L. Cann, et al.

In order to do more with less material, reducing the immensity of metal consumption, one of the opportunities common to
multiple alloy groups is the simultaneous improvement of both strength and ductility. In steels, this can be achieved by using third
generation AHSS; however, these steels are susceptible to damage due to their multi-phase nature, and the underlying damage
mechanisms must be better understood before third generation AHSS can be widely used. The strength and ductility of α + β titanium alloys can likewise be improved by adjusting transformation pathways and increasing the nucleation rate of the α phase by
the introduction of tailored metastable phases. In the field of high entropy and complex concentrated alloys, metallurgists have a
huge number of possible systems to investigate and insights to gain (including from fields not traditionally considered as high entropy
and complex concentrated alloys, such as functional materials). In the midst of these numerous options, promising paths forward may
increase strength and toughness by introducing metallic precipitates and increasing short range ordering.
Another approach to reducing metal consumption is to increase the lifetime of alloys. This can be by increasing fatigue life and
wear resistance and decreasing environmental damage in steels, or by addressing cold-dwell fatigue in near-α Ti alloys. Similarly, the
unique opportunity to decrease electricity costs by using shape memory alloys in heat pump applications can only be implemented
after functional lifetimes are increased. Increasing alloy lifetime can also be achieved through reuse or recycling. Ideally, reuse by
relocating, cascading, and reforming materials would be promoted over recycling, which is less energetically sustainable and has its
own set of challenges.
Energy efficiency enabled by materials in service must also be considered. Magnesium alloys, aluminum alloys, and lightweighted
steel alloys all enable energy savings in the automobile industry. Then, there is the clear relationship between material properties and
energy efficiency in high temperature applications. In aluminum alloys, high temperature stability can be improved by incorporating
both stable L12 precipitates with sustainable alloying elements and α-Al(Mn,Mo)Si precipitates. In γ-titanium alloys, metastable
phases formed at elevated temperatures must be controlled or eliminated. In superalloys, where the challenge is, as ever, to increase
melting temperatures for application in turbine engines, the field is pushing towards Co-based superalloys with stabilized L12precipitates designed and studied through DFT and other computational tools.
In each path forward, alloy design must also consider the sustainability of constituent elements from a life cycle perspective. Ore
extraction, processing, recycling when possible, as well as the service use of alloys must be considered. To this end, metallurgists are
replacing scandium in aluminum alloys, suggesting sustainability-informed reduced design spaces for high entropy alloys, and engineering alloys to be more compatible with recycling capabilities.
To inform alloy design choices discussed above, theory and computational approaches are necessary. Magnesium alloy research,
for example, provides an opportunity to display the potential of an ICME approach to make a rapid impact. DFT calculations to
calculate L12 phase stability and stacking fault energies are employed to guide the search for helpful alloying elements in Co-based
superalloys, and these calculations are being supplemented with CALPHAD to expand the design space. Similar approaches are being
taken to explore the design space of high entropy and complex concentrated alloys. However, the approaches mentioned throughout
this review are merely highlights of the field, and there are many opportunities left to explore through other tools including (but not
limited to) Monte Carlo techniques, phase-field methods, finite element methods, and other statistical methods.
As a result of the increasing quantities [20] and varieties [11] of metals used, the environmental burden from primary production
alone has become tremendous, accounting for 7–8% of global energy consumption, and is projected to increase, causing further
increased carbon dioxide emissions, acidification, aquatic ecotoxicity, and more [377]. However, the increasingly negative impact of
metal production can be confronted through deliberate decisions in alloy design and production. We have identified a handful of the
most auspicious challenges and opportunities faced by the industry above. Through conscientious alloy design, we can address the
urgent environmental challenges and find a sustainable path forward.

Appendix A. Elastocaloric heat pump concepts
The most famous elastocaloric concept is Tusek’s regenerator [379–381], Fig. A1. Starting above Ms in the austenite, the superelastic material is loaded and transforms to martensite, producing heat as the loading device does work. A piston then moves
water from the cold side heat exchanger over the regenerator to the hot side. At the hot side, heat is then extracted, cooling the
working fluid. The regenerator is then compressed (above Ms) and the material transforms back to austenite, cooling the regenerator.
The piston reverses its motion and moves fluid back from the outlet of the hot side heat exchanger to the cold side, cooling it below

ambient temperature on the cold side. At the cold side heat exchanger, the external fluid (e.g. outside air) then warms the working
fluid and the cycle repeats.
From the above discussion, it seems likely that a practical elastocaloric device must have a high surface-area-to-volume ratio; for a
complete cycle to occur at 12.5 Hz, heat transfer must complete within ~1/50 s = 20 ms. This makes open-cell foams seem like an
attractive solution, or other heat-exchanger type structures. They will presumably be operated in compression, to minimise issues
associated with fatigue, and must be coupled to a highly efficient mechanical device, such as a motor-driven reciprocating piston
engine.
Many fabrication methods might be contemplated to produce such structures, from brazing tubes, stacks of parallel sheets,
deforming sheets and brazing to produce honeycomb-type structures, ice templating and sintering, laser or electron beam powder bed
or blown powder additive manufacturing, liquid metal infiltration into a leachable skeleton (e.g. salt), metal injection molding or ink
jet printing and sintering. Many routes are under investigation for the production of high surface area engineering structures; the final
outcome will depend on a delicate optimisation of manufacturability for cost.
It should also be noted that natural gas-driven heat pumps also exist using vapour compression cycles (at lower COP); this concept
might be transferable for caloric materials if bias springs are used, as for superelastic NiTi actuators, heating the caloric using the
coolant and then using the stress-assisted transformation from the bias spring to return to the martensite state. This would provide a
way to use natural gas, at elevated COP, to allow for winter storage until insulation efforts and grid reinforcement provide sufficient
amounts of electricity during seasonal peaks.
An alternative cycle proposed by the group at Fraunhofer IPM uses evaporative cooling and condensation, in combination with
linking the regenerators in series as thermal diodes, to help overcome the heat transfer challenge and therefore achieve higher rates of
cycling of the overall device [382]. This approach, which bears comparison to traditional vapour compression refrigeration cycles,
would seem to be attractive.

Abstract

In recent years, the SLM process has been studied for the production of aluminum alloy parts, as these

CC
E

alloys demonstrate significant potential for the future, notably due to their low density which allows a
considerable reduction in mass. The aim of this bibliographical study is to identify and classify the
parameters and phenomena which influence the appearance of defects in aluminum alloy parts

A

produced using the SLM process and hence the final properties of these parts. To do this, a cause tree
diagram was created. For each defect or consequence identified (porosities, defects linked with hot
cracking phenomena, anisotropy in the material and surface quality), we revealed the potential sources
of the appearance of this defect, going back to the initial causes.

Selective Laser Melting (SLM) – Aluminum alloys – Defects
1. Introduction
Additive manufacturing is not a single process, but a set of techniques with one principle in common,
that of shaping parts by the addition of material [1]: depositing layer by layer, depositing by spraying
matter, depositing by fused filament fabrication, etc. The basic principle used in these techniques is

IP
T

therefore the opposite of traditional shaping which involves the removal of material (machining
processes). Additive manufacturing processes complement existing shaping processes (machining,

SC
R

welding, molding, injection, forming, etc.) by making it possible to produce new types of parts with
more complex geometries. Depending on the processes, the materials used are mainly in the form of

liquids, powders, filaments or sheets and all families of materials can be used with this process,

U

polymers, metals, ceramics, composites, biomaterials, etc.

N

The Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is an additive manufacturing process using a powder bed where a

A

quasi-finished product is produced from metal powders and a 3D CAD file. A great deal of research

M

has been done into the SLM process applied to steels [2], Nickel-Chrome alloys [3] or titanium alloys
[4,5]. Studies have also tended to focus also on aluminum alloys. Aluminum and its alloys do indeed

ED

have great potential for the future, due in particular to their low density which can result in significant
reductions in volume. Due to the fast heating and cooling rates during SLM building during SLM

PT

building, the microstructures obtained with SLM and and consequently the mechanical behavior are
different compared to traditionally fabricated Al–12Si parts [6-8]. Moreover, despite being studied for

CC
E

more than twenty years, the final properties of aluminum alloy parts manufactured by SLM are still
difficult to control due to the numerous defects generated, porosities, hot cracking and consequences,
poor surface state or anisotropy.

A

Because of interactions between the laser and the metal powders, the SLM process involves
combinations of physical and thermal phenomena (with phase changes linked with the melting and
solidification of metal powders), metallurgical phenomena (diffusion), mechanical phenomena
(appearance of residual stresses due to temperature gradients during the process) and hydrodynamic
phenomena (convection in the melt pool). In the case of the manufacture of aluminum alloy parts,

2

macrographs and analysis of the microstructure show the formation of oxides at the surface of the melt
pool which may be responsible for the appearance of defects such as porosities and the trapping of
unmelted powders. The material health of parts produced from aluminum is therefore particularly
related to the size of the melt pools and the ability of the laser to break the oxide films that have
formed, which are themselves directly linked to the operational parameters of the process. In addition,

IP
T

aluminum is a good heat conductor compared with other metal alloys used but it has a lower
absorption rate of the laser beam energy, hence a very large proportion of the laser energy is reflected.

The aim of this bibliographic article is to investigate the origins of the main defects observed in

SC
R

aluminum alloy parts manufactured by SLM, in order to identify and classify the parameters and
phenomena involved which influence the final properties and hence the appearance of defects. A well-

U

known risk analysis was used, the root cause analysis tree diagram. The principle is simple: for each
defect identified, potential sources are revealed, going back to the initial causes, also called the root

A

N

causes.

2. Defects in SLM production of aluminium alloy parts

In the literature, SLM is often associated with SLS (Selective Laser Sintering) [9], however, these two

PT

additive manufacturing processes are quite distinct, even though their basic principle is the same.
Figure 1 shows a system where powder is fed via a tank located above the level of the construction

CC
E

zone. Its distribution in the recoater is made by gravity. Then, powder is deposited on the build
substrate thanks to the recoater movement. Another system deposits powder by an “elevator” powder
reservoir [10]. Layer after layer, the lateral reserve is raised to deliver the required amount of powder.

A

In both cases, the powder is then spread in a thin uniform layer across the build surface using a
recoater mechanism that may be a rake, which may be flexible or hard, or a roller. The deposited
powder is between 10 and 100 µm thick. In the case of aluminum alloys, it is generally around 30 to
50 µm [11-14]. The thickness of the powder deposit depends on the granulometry of the powder used;
it corresponds to a slice of the part being produced, a slice that will then be sintered (SLS) or melted

3

(SLM) depending on the process employed. The energy required to change the state of the material is
provided by a laser.
The main difference between sintering and laser fusion is the power of the laser used. In SLS, the
powder is sintered. The temperature to be reached varies according to the grade of the aluminum alloy,
but is generally between 595°C and 625°C [15]. For SLM, on the other hand, the temperature to be

IP
T

reached is at least the melting temperature of aluminum (T ≥ 660°C). As a result, the physical
phenomena involved are different. In the case of SLM, the mechanics of the melt fluids play a major

part in the final quality of the parts. The sintering process is complicated to put into operation on

SC
R

aluminum powders because of the natural presence of a thin layer of alumina [16].

Using a laser to melt the material gives the SLM process some similarities to laser assembly processes.

U

Basically, a part made by SLM could be represented as a pile of laser weld beads. However, these 2
processes differ in some important ways and the results obtained for welded parts in terms of

N

microstructures and defects in particular cannot be transposed to the SLM process. The dimensions of

A

laser weld beads are a minimum of a few mm, whereas in the case of SLM, laser thicknesses are

M

around a hundred microns maximum. In addition, the scan speeds of the laser are much lower during

ED

welding than in SLM and hence the cooling speeds of the alloy are also very different as they are
extremely fast in SLM (~ 106 K.s-1). The thermal history during the process is also more disrupted in

PT

the case of SLM: a layer of powders that melts as the laser passes across at a given moment will
undergo variations in temperature as the laser passes over to make the upper layers (figure 2) [17]. The

CC
E

environment of the melt pool is also very different: in welding, melting occurs all the time within one
or more materials in the solid state (parts for assembly) (figure 3) [18] whereas in the case of SLM on
a powder bed, depending on the geometry of the part being produced and the laser strategy used, the

A

weld bead is either in contact with the powder or with the continuous material in the solid state, or
with a combination of the two, as illustrated in figure 4.

2.2. Parameters of the SLM process
To master the SLM process and thus account for the appearance of a particular defect, it is essential to
know and understand all the operational factors that can influence the final properties of the
4

manufactured product. The key parameters of SLM are presented in detail by Spears [10]. Spears
classifies the parameters into 4 categories: laser parameters, initial powder properties, powder bed
properties and recoating, and build environment parameters. Parameters defined as “controlled” are
those that can be easily modified with current SLM technology. Of the 50 parameters listed, only a

IP
T

dozen are considered to be controllable, i.e. directly modifiable during the process.

To these fifty parameters identified by Spears, it is essential to add further parameters which can
impact on the quality of the final part:

the flowability of the powders: poor flowability can lead to problems with spreading the

SC
R

-

powder;

the hygrometry of the powders: high humidity can also lead to problems with spreading the

U

-

powders;

the recoating technique used to spread the powders (roller or rake): some machines control the

N

-

A

compacting of the powders and others spread the powders on both the outward sweep and the

M

return sweep.

ED

In view of the very large number of parameters and following studies that have focused on the
parameters of the laser and the scanning, 4 of these parameters were studied through the specific laser

PT

energy Ψ, defined according to equation (1) [19,20]:
𝑃

𝛹 = 𝜈.ℎ.𝑑

(1)

CC
E

where P is the power of the laser (W), v the scan speed of the laser (mm/s), h the inter-bead distance
(mm) and d the thickness of the layer of powder deposited (mm). Thus the energy density of the
process increases if the laser power increases, or if the scan speed, the inter-bead distance or the

A

thickness of the layer decreases. There is a basic optimal specific energy, but its value seems to be
dependent on the overall environment and hence on the SLM machine and the alloy used [20].
However, this equation is debatable. Indeed, it does not take into account a number of important
factors such as the laser diameter and its offsets at the surface of the melt, the direction of the gas flow,
the hatch style and so on [21]. Prashanth et al claims that an extensive modification of the equation has

5

to be made involving the hatch parameters and the material properties in order to effectively employ
this in the SLM parameter optimization process. By comparing samples build using different process
parameters at constant energy density by varying the laser power and laser speed combination and at
constant speed and varying laser, their study suggests that the laser power is one of the most

IP
T

influencing process parameter to be considered.

2.3. SLM process applied to aluminum alloys

Manufacturers of metal additive manufacturing machines have chosen to use lasers with a wavelength

SC
R

of 1µm (1.064µm) because this allows optimal absorption for all metal materials (figure 5) [22].

Nevertheless, for aluminum, laser absorption for a wavelength of 1064 nm is low, varying between 5

U

and 15%. In the case of wavelengths close to 10µm (CO2 laser) the oxide layer Al2O3 naturally present
on the surface of the powder particles probably absorbs the laser energy better in this wavelength

N

range (figure 6) [23].

A

In the literature, all laser sources used emit in continuous mode. A few rare studies have looked into

M

the possibility of using pulsed sources to allow time for the heat to diffuse into the material between 2

ED

pulses [24]. Chou et al. demonstrated that the change in laser emission mode significantly modifies the
geometry of the microstructure obtained in the case of an AlSi12 alloy and therefore influences the

PT

final properties of the material.

CC
E

2.4. Aluminum alloys produced by SLM
Overall, the most commonly studied aluminums in SLM belong to the group of alloys called structural
hardening alloys. Table 1 summarizes the principal aluminum alloys that have already been studied in

A

SLM giving the references to bibliographic articles dealing with each of the alloys. The presence of
alloying elements such as Cu, Mg, Si and Zn make it possible to improve the mechanical properties by
a sequence of heat treatments. The majority of these alloys are reputed to be easily weldable, including
with a high energy process and rapid kinetics such as laser welding.
We observed that most studies were carried out using the 4XXX series (40,000 casting alloys). These
alloys are easy to process due to the small difference between liquidus and solidus temperature. In
6

addition the fact that these alloys have high silicon content gives a better laser absorption, avoids
cracking and gives the material good flowability and weldability properties. Today we easily obtain
parts with densities exceeding 99% using high laser powers of 200W and above. Moreover, taking the
example of AlSi10Mg, which is without a doubt the most studied aluminium alloy studied by SLM,
the mechanical properties of parts produced by SLM are higher than the one obtained by casting. It is

IP
T

explained due to the fine cellular-dendritic microstructure and fine distribution of Si phase developed.
More and more studies are focused on the Al-Cu alloys (2XXX series). These high strength aluminium
alloys represent a great potential for automotive, aerospace and defense industries. Actually, with a

SC
R

higher strength-to-weight ratio than aluminium-silicon alloys, the expectation of reduction in mass is

increased. The high risk of failures to create dense part with classical Al-Cu alloys – due to the well-

U

known susceptibility to hot cracking in welding - explains why it was first necessary to develop the
SLM process with aluminium alloy easy to process, as 4XXX series. The results indicate that these Al-

N

alloys display fine microstructure and considerably improved mechanical properties. Similar findings

A

can be associated to Al-alloys from 7XXX series.

M

Concerning 5XXX series, it should be noted that one particular alloy was developed by the Airbus

ED

Group Innovation in order to find a compromise between the lightness of aluminum alloys and
titanium alloy resistance: the Scalmalloy®. Due to its specific composition, this AlMgScZr alloys

CC
E

properties.

PT

offers excellent material properties in terms of weldability, corrosion resistance and mechanical

2.5. Main defects and consequences identified on aluminum parts produced by SLM
As in smelting and welding, four main defects and consequences were identified in the aluminum

A

alloy parts produced by SLM: porosities, defects related to hot cracking phenomena, anisotropy
induced in the material and surface quality. From this set of defects, we can start to build the cause
tree diagram (figure 7). For each case, we searched for all the causes for their appearance and grouped
all this information together to complete the tree shown in Figure 7, while systematically giving, for
each cause, the bibliographic references for where they were studied. It can be seen that many causes
are common to several defects.
7

3. Porosities related to the production of aluminum alloy parts by SLM
3.1. Causes of the appearance of porosities
Porosities are considered as one of the major defects in parts produced by SLM [67]. The density of a
part is an indicator of its material health and hence of the final performance that can be expected [68].

IP
T

The size and the shape of a porosity are generally characteristics of the phenomenon that has caused it
[69]. Thus, we can classified the porosities of a SLM part into 2 categories: metallurgical pores which
originate either from the absorption of the surrounding gas (N, O or H), or from the evaporation of

SC
R

certain alloying elements (e.g. Mg), and parameter based pores which are mainly the result of a
process fault.

Also, the size of these porosities is a revealing indicator of material health which affects the

U

performance of the final part. Thus “macroporosities” are considered more harmful than

N

microporosities. Indeed, if they are not perfectly spherical, macroporosities can be the source of

A

cracks. Consequently, the more macroporosities there are, the more fragile the material will be.

M

“Initial” microporosities may become critical, especially after heat treatment. During such operations

ED

it can be seen that microporosities have a tendency to coalesce, forming macroporosities that are
acicular in shape and therefore likely to generate the problems already discussed.

PT

Among the causes of the appearance of porosities are those related to the process parameters, to the
presence of impurities on the base material (the powder), to the low absorption of laser energy by the

CC
E

aluminum, to problems of wettability of the solid aluminum by the liquid aluminum, to the
atmospheric conditions in the combustion chamber, or to phenomena of evaporation of the elements
that make up the composition of the alloy. We built the tree for each of these causes, showing the

A

studies in the literature (Figure 8).
It should be recalled that all the studies dealing with the density of the parts produced by SLM are
dependent on the experimental means used. When the porosity level of a part is measured, the
dimension of the porosities being considered is usually not specified. Thus, depending on the method
used, determining the porosity level can give varying results.

8

3.2. Influence of the process on the appearance of porosities
The majority of studies on reducing the rate of porosity within a material produced by SLM focus on
the process, and especially on the optimization of the energy density factor, presented previously (1).
The parameters recognized as being the most influential for porosity levels are the laser scan speed
and laser power [12,20,24,26,30,36,43,45]. For instance, Kimura et al studied the influence of the

IP
T

level of energy density on the kind of porosities [12]. By optimizing the laser irradiation conditions, a
relative density of 99.8% is obtained on A356.0 specimens. On as-build part, they showed that the

relative density of the part decreased at both higher and lower energy density. In low-energy density

SC
R

specimen, porosities were attributable to incomplete melting of the powder layer due to insufficient
energy supply from laser irradiation. It results porosities with an irregularly shaped and contained

U

residual powder particles. In high-energy density case, they find a lot of spherical porosities with the
morphological features of gas pores. This is attributed either to a trapping of the argon from the

N

combustion chamber due to the active flow of the molten metal, or to the dissolved hydrogen having

A

degassed at the time of fusion.

M

Buchbinder et al. produced parts from aluminum alloy Al Si10 Mg with a volume of 5 mm3 and a

ED

relative density of around 99.5% using a laser power of 250 W [70,71]. They showed that by simply
increasing the laser power (~1000W), combined with an optimized laser speed and inter-bead distance,

PT

the volume of the manufactured parts could be significantly increased with the same relative density
(99.5%), while the build rate increased from 5 mm3/s to 21 mm3/s [43]. In this case, it has been

CC
E

showed that low density of samples is also caused by spattering and process instabilities, which
produced imperfections. The gas flow at the surface of the lasered area is also a parameter that
influences the porosity level [72]. Depending on the position and flow rate of the gas, slag (powder

A

that has already melted) may be present in the powder bed which leads to melting defects during
lasering and hence porosities.

3.3. Influence of other parameters on the appearance of porosities
In order to limit the appearance of porosities associated with the presence of hydrogen during the SLM
process, one method is to reduce the presence of humidity at the surface of the powder bed. To do this,
9

Weingarten et al. proposed a double scan system of the powder bed: a first scan is carried out with a
low power laser resulting in the sintering of the powder; the second scan is the one that melts the
powder [44]. This initial laser application reduces porosity density by 90% when producing an
AlSi10Mg alloy. Other authors have shown that porosity can be considerably reduced by drying the
powder before placing it in the SLM machine [46].

IP
T

Studies have shown that decreasing the oxygen content in the machine results in a decrease in porosity
associated with the presence of oxygen [60]. In addition, Louvis et al. recall difficulties in producing

thermal conductivity of these materials [36].

U

4. Other defects in aluminum alloy parts produced by SLM

SC
R

aluminum alloy parts by SLM because of the combined effects of the very high reflectivity and

4.1. Hot cracking defects

N

Another defect encountered when laser welding aluminum alloys is hot cracking [73]. As there is a

A

large solidification range, we observe a lack of supply of liquid to the interdendritic spaces of the weld

M

metal zone during solidification, which causes cracking.

ED

One method to avoid these cracks is to modify the composition of the welded alloy to increase the
amount of eutectic. In particular, the addition of Silicon to the alloy reduces the melting temperature

PT

and the solidification range, thus leading to a decrease in the level of hot cracking [74]. Adding Nickel
to the alloy can also reduce the appearance of cracks [64].

CC
E

To limit these cracking problems when producing aluminum parts by SLM, most studies were carried
out using what are called casting aluminum alloys (AlSi10Mg, AlSi12, AlSi7Mg0.3), which are less
susceptible to the risk of hot cracking because of the high Silicon content (figure 9) [75] and their

A

limited solidification range (ΔT ~50°C).
To understand the reasons why this defect appears, we looked in particular at the phenomena present
during laser welding (figure 10).
In his work on 6XXX series aluminum alloy laser welding, Fabrègue identified 5 factors that influence
hot cracking: the composition of the alloy, the microstructure, the dissolved gas content, the
wettability of the solid by the liquid and the process [76]. Sanchez et al. showed that the susceptibility
10

of an aluminum alloy to cracking depends on both its composition and the laser parameters used
(power, speed) [77]. It exits similarities between these phenomena and those observed in on SLM
process. Zhang et al. found that, in the case of an Al-Cu-Mg alloy, which is known to be sensitive to
cracking because of the presence of copper and magnesium, the reduction in laser speed leads to a
decrease in the presence of defects, including cracks [56]. Montero et al. successfully manufactured

IP
T

parts out of alloy 7075 by SLM with no cracking by doping the composition with silicon [59].
Bartkowiak et al don’t observed cracks in their SLM samples manufactured with AlCu, ALZn or

SC
R

AlSi10Mg [29].

4.2. Anisotropy of manufactured parts

U

Another consequence identified when producing aluminum parts by SLM concerns the anisotropy of
mechanical properties. This may appear to be secondary when compared with the two defects

N

mentioned previously, but studies show that mechanical properties depend on the build direction of the

M

nature of the aluminum parts produced by SLM.

A

part (Figure 11). Figure 12 summarizes the causes identified as being responsible for the anisotropic

ED

There are two causes that may explain this microstructure orientation. The first concerns the build
orientation of the part: because of the complex thermal history that the part has undergone, we observe

PT

epitaxial grain growth [78]. During the study of the overall texture of AlSi10Mg produced by SLM
Thijs et al have demonstrated that a more anisotropic or isotropic part can be obtained by choosing the

CC
E

applied scanning strategy [51].

During their studies concerning the impact of processing parameters on tensile properties, Prashanth et
al have showed that some combination of parameters may lead to anisotropic properties in the material

A

due to not homogeneous throughout the length of the AlSi12 samples produced by SLM [79]. This
criterion must therefore be taken into account when choosing the orientation and the support of the
part during the CAD stage (pre-manufacture).
Some authors have observed anisotropy in mechanical properties about samples manufactured by
SLM: longitudinal fracture strains were greater than those observed in the transversal direction in an
AlSi7Mg0.3 alloy produced by SLM in optimal conditions [12]; the elongation for parts built in
11

transversal direction is almost 2% higher than the elongation in the longitudinal direction with an
AlSi10Mg alloy [41] and the hardness observed along the build direction is higher than the
perpendicular one with the same alloy [42]. Karg et al have also observed anisotropy in the elongation
at break with an AlCu6Mn alloy while yield strength and ultimate tensile strength were isotropic [31]
and anisotropy for elongation and ultimate tensile strength with AlCu2Mg1.5Ni [61]. Other authors

IP
T

have observed isotropic properties on their specimens on AlSiMg [48] or very low anisotropy on
Scalmalloy [26].

SC
R

4.3. Study of surface conditions

An optimal use of the SLM process would be the possibility of producing an operational part using

U

SLM, where no post-processing machine finishing is required. To date, this goal has not yet been
achieved as surface conditions obtained after SLM do not fulfill the specifications for certain

N

applications, particularly aeronautics. Studying this consequence is therefore a means to improve the

M

bring about improvement in this criterion.

A

process, especially in the case of aluminum alloys. Figure 13 shows the various avenues to explore to

ED

Few studies so far have looked into this problem. Currently, the solution usually employed to improve
surface condition is to vary the laser parameters locally on the contours of the parts. However, this

PT

change in the operational parameters may lead to the formation of porosities in the parts. The laser
parameters used will directly affect the stability of the melt pool obtained and hence the uniformity of

CC
E

the final bead [36, 45]. The phenomenon of balling, where coarse molten metal droplets are formed, is
also observed in SLM. This phenomenon depends on processing parameters and acts to the surface
quality: Olakanmi has showed the influence of laser power and scanning rate about surface

A

morphology [47] ; Louvis et al have observed that low scan speeds generate roughness greater than the
set layer thickness with AlSi12 [36] ; Calignano et al studied the influence of laser and process
parameters like laser beam, power, spot size scanning speed, hatching distance and layer thickness
about the surface quality of AlSi10Mg produced by SLM [80]. In addition of these parameters, the
surface quality depends also on scan strategies such as contour scans and skywriting scans: the surface

12

roughness can be improved by means of a contour scan to alleviate surface inhomogeneity, and by
skywriting to facilitate scanning with more uniform energy density [81].

5. Conclusion
Studies of the SLM process cover very many different grades of aluminium alloy. SLM creates

IP
T

complex functional products by selectively melting powder particles of a powder bed layer after layer
using a high-energy laser beam. The high-energy density applied to the material with SLM processing,
the fast heating and cooling rates during SLM building and the additive character of the process result

SC
R

in a material which microstructure and properties are different from those of materials manufactured

with traditional process. Like any other process, SLM applied to the aluminum alloy parts involves

U

specific defects (porosities, defects related to hot cracking phenomena) and other consequences
concerning anisotropy induced in the material and surface quality. From each set of defects, according

N

to the literature studies, we have proposed a cause tree diagram which detailed all causes responsible

A

for the occurrence of defects.

M

The parameters of the process, the wettability of aluminium by melted aluminium, the low absorption

ED

of laser energy and the presence of impurities have been identified as the main causes of the presence
of porosities and hot cracking. It should be added the evaporation of the elements of alloys

PT

composition and the atmosphere of building room for the porosities and the alloy composition and the
dissolved gas content for hot cracking.

CC
E

The parameters of the process and the bailing effect the surface quality while the building direction
and plate preheating are the two principles parameters responsible of the presence of anisotropy.
Each of the causes of each defect has been then detailed in a cause tree diagram with literature

A

references corresponding.
Future research should focus on defining new grades of aluminium alloy that can limit defects such as
porosities and cracking. Furthermore, the SLM process involves complex coupled phenomena
associated with interactions between the laser and the material, initially in the form of powders. In
order to study and fully understand defects in such a complex process, instrumentation needs to be
developed which will be able to monitor changes in physical quantities during the process and modify
13

certain parameters while the process is underway. These studies can be developed from SLM
machines but also from instrumented test benches which can reproduce physical phenomena that are
representative of the SLM process.

2D PdAg Alloy Nanodendrites for Enhanced Ethanol
Electroxidation
Wenjing Huang, Xiaolin Kang, Cheng Xu, Junhua Zhou, Jun Deng, Yanguang Li,*
and Si Cheng*
the introduction of the second component
may significantly modify the electronic
structure of Pd and consequently weaken
its affinity for poisonous adspecies.[4,5] In
spite of some encouraging progress over
recent years, the improvement in durability is still unsatisfactory.
On the other hand, nanostructuring
of electrocatalysts represents another
effective strategy to expose surface active
sites and improve their electrochemical
performance.[7–10] 2D metallic nanodendrites are a rare class of materials with
high structural anisotropy.[11] They have
enlarged surface areas and abundant
undercoordinated sites, can provide a
natural framework for the investigations
of defective systems, and may hold unexpected promise for catalytic applications.
However, their formation condition is very
stringent and requires the thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically driven ramification within
2D and at the same time suppressed crystal growth along the
normal direction. Particularly important is that the in-plane
growth rate should be sufficiently fast that it becomes diffusion
limited.[12,13] Insufficient in-plane growth rate would instead
result in common 2D nanoplates or nanosheets. The concomitance of expedited in-plane growth and suppressed out-of-plane
growth is difficult to achieve unless with the assistance of
proper structural directing agents (surfactants) under well-regulated conditions.[11] As a result, the preparation of 2D metallic
nanodendrites is highly challenging and seldom reported in literature as far as we are aware.
In this study, we present the facile preparation of intriguing
2D PdAg alloy nanodendrites (PdAg NDs) in aqueous solution
under ambient conditions. The introduction of octadecyltrimethylammonium chloride (OTAC) as the structure directing
agent is found to hold the decisive key to the formation of this
highly anisotropic structure. Thanks to the synergistic coupling
between the two alloy components and the advantageous nanostructure, PdAg nanodendrites enable excellent electrocatalytic
activity and durability for EOR in alkaline solution.
2D PdAg NDs were synthesized from the simultaneous
reduction of H2PdCl4 and AgNO3 by ascorbic acid in their
aqueous solution with the presence of OTAC at 20 oC (see Experimental Section for details). This reaction was rapid (completed
in minutes), mild (used no hazardous solvents or chemicals),
reproducible, and could be potentially scaled up to gram-scale.

The development of highly active and stable electrocatalysts for ethanol electroxidation is of decisive importance to the successful commercialization of
direct ethanol fuel cells. Despite great efforts invested over the past decade,
their progress has been notably slower than expected. In this work, the facile
solution synthesis of 2D PdAg alloy nanodendrites as a high-performance
electrocatalyst is reported for ethanol electroxidation. The reaction is carried
out via the coreduction of Pd and Ag precursors in aqueous solution with the
presence of octadecyltrimethylammonium chloride as the structural directing
agent. Final products feature small thickness (5–7 nm) and random in-plane
branching with enlarged surface areas and abundant undercoordinated
sites. They exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic activity (large specific current
−1) and excellent operation stability (as revealed from both the
≈ 2600 mA mg Pd
cycling and chronoamperometric tests) for ethanol electroxidation. Control
experiments show that the improvement comes from the combined electronic and structural effects.

Direct ethanol fuel cells are promising energy conversion
devices that operate based on the electroxidation of ethanol.
They potentially have large energy and power density, but fall
far short of expectation due to the lack of high-performance
anode electrocatalysts.[1–3] Pd-based materials have been widely
investigated for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) in alkaline
solution and yet generally suffer from insufficient activity and
poor durability as the result of their rapid poisoning by carbonaceous reaction intermediates and byproducts.[3–6] A possible
strategy to promote their durability is alloying Pd with other
metals, such as Ag, Co, Cu, Ru, or Sn.[3–5] It is suggested that

OTAC was found of critical importance to induce the formation
of 2D nanodendrites as would be described in detail later. The
alloy composition could be readily varied by tuning the starting
molar ratio of the two metal precursors. For the sake of clarity,
our following discussion would center on the product with a
nominal Pd/Ag ratio of 1:1 unless otherwise specified.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of PdAg NDs displayed a
single set of diffraction peaks assignable to a face centered
cubic structure (Figure 1a). Each of them was located between
corresponding peaks of pure Pd and pure Ag, evidencing the
formation of PdAg alloy rather than phase separation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images revealed that the final
product took the shape of 2D nanodendrites with an average
lateral size of ≈80 nm (Figure 1b,c). They consisted of several
branches radially extending out from a common core, resembling beautiful snowflakes but with no rigorous symmetry.
From the overlapping edges of two nanodendrites, we inferred
that they were semitransparent to the electron beam and therefore had a small thickness. High-resolution TEM examination
of the core (Figure 1d) and branch region (Figure 1e) of nanodendrites unveiled clear lattice fringes corresponding to the
(111) plane of PdAg alloy. Selected area electron diffraction
(SAED) pattern over an entire nanodendrite showed that it was
close to single crystalline (Figure 1f). Indexing these diffraction
spots led us to conclude that 2D PdAg NDs were terminated with
the {110} basal plane, presumably due to the surface passivation
by OTAC. This preferential surface passivation was in agreement
with previous observation that quaternary ammonium cationic
surfactant with a long alkyl chain could stabilize {110} facets in
the formation of rhombic dodecahedral AuPd nanocrystals.[14]
Elemental mapping under scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM) disclosed that the distribution of Pd and Ag
had a high spatial correlation and again supported the formation

Adv. Mater. 2018, 1706962

of uniform alloy (Figure 1g–j). PdAg NDs were also subjected to
atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement (Figure 1k). From
a random height profile across the nanodendrite, we estimated
that its core was ≈5 nm thick, and its branch was slightly thicker
(≈7 nm). It translated to an aspect ratio of >10 for 2D PdAg
NDs. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
spectra exhibited signals from both Pd and Ag (Figure 2). Peak
deconvolution revealed the contribution from both metallic and
oxidized (Ag+, Pd2+, and Pd4+) species.[15,16] The latter was probably caused by the surface partial oxidation upon exposure to air.
Inductive coupled plasma (ICP) analysis determined the actual
Pd/Ag molar ratio in PdAg NDs to be 1.18.
Above microscopic and spectroscopic characterizations
corroborated that 2D PdAg NDs had a uniform chemical composition and highly anisotropic structure with in-plane radial
branching and small thickness. We reasoned that their two
formation criteria were the suppressed out-of-plane crystal
growth and the fast in-plane crystal growth. The introduction
of OTAC was believed to selectively passivate the {110} plane
and thereby induce this 2D nanostructure. On the other hand,
the coreduction of Pd and Ag by ascorbic acid at room temperature was fast. It led to rapid crystal nucleation and subsequently
the diffusion-limited 2D aggregation of these nuclei or clusters
to form the dendritic structure—presumably via the oriented
attachment for its observed quasi-single-crystallinity. It was
noteworthy that diffusion-limited aggregation was a popular
growth model of many fractal or dendritic structures,[12,13]
and slower reaction rate would only result in solid structures.
The fast reaction rate here unfortunately impeded our efforts
to track the time-dependent morphological evolution of PdAg
NDs. In order to gain more insights about the possible growth
mechanism and critical synthetic parameters, a range of control
experiments were performed as detailed in what follows.

Figure 2. a) Ag 3d and b) Pd 3d XPS spectra of PdAg NDs. Peaks were deconvoluted to reflect different contributions.

First, we investigated the effect of surfactant and found its
long alkyl chain was important to the formation of 2D dendrites.
Only irregular nanoparticles were resulted in the absence of any
surfactant (Figure 3a). When OTAC was replaced by quaternary
ammonium cationic surfactants with shorter alkyl chains such
as dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride, tetradecyltrimethyl­
ammonium chloride, and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride under otherwise identical conditions, the final products
had drastically different morphology and mainly consisted of
3D clusters of nanoparticles (Figure 3c,d). Surfactant chain length
was known to affect its binding on nanocrystal surface.[17,18] Our
observation might reflect the stronger interaction between the
metal surface and OTAC compared to its shorter alkyl chain
alternatives. Previously, Shelnutt and co-workers suggested
that 2D Pt nanodendrites could be prepared by templating

large unilamellar liposomes.[11] Similar templating effect of
the surfactant vesicles might also be reasonably expected here.
Changing the alkyl chain length could modify the structure of
surfactant micelles and consequently gave rise to alloy products
with different morphologies.
Second, we explored the effect of reaction temperature as
shown in Figure 3e–h. It was expected to significantly impact
both the reaction rate and the surfactant binding on the metal
surface. We found that 20 oC was the optimal reaction temperature. When it was lowered to 4 °C, PdAg alloy still had the
2D preferential growth, but lost the overall circular shape and
became more irregularly branched. The branches were also
considerably larger in size. This observation could be rationalized by the interplay between crystal nucleation, growth, and
aggregation. Lower reaction temperature reduced the density of

crystal nuclei and allowed each of them to grow bigger before
oriented attachment took place. When the reaction temperature
was raised beyond 30 oC, the capping or templating effect of
OTAC seemed to diminish, and porous clusters of nanoparticles were yielded probably driven by 3D-oriented attachment.
Furthermore, we varied the starting Pd/Ag molar ratio and
examined its impact on the product morphology (Figure 3i–l).
In absence of any Ag precursor, 3D Pd nanodendrites were
obtained (Figure 3i), while no solid product could be collected
when the reaction was conducted without Pd. This suggested
that the presence and coreduction of Pd and Ag were crucial
to the formation of the unique 2D nanodendrites, and PdAg
alloy exhibited a markedly different crystal growth behavior
from pure Pd or Ag. When the starting Pd/Ag molar ratio
was tuned within the range of 0.25–2, the final product morphology remained more or less similar. Their actual Pd/Ag
ratios were measured and summarized in Table S1 (Supporting
Information).
These control experiments attested that the formation of
PdAg NDs was the result of a careful control and balance over
several synthetic parameters. As far as we were aware, our study
represented the first successful preparation of 2D alloy nanodendrites. Compared to other existing alloy nanostructures that
were mostly solid,[19–21] we believed that our PdAg NDs—with
its enlarged surface area and abundant defective surface sites—
might hold unexpected promise for catalytic applications.
Next, we assessed the electrocatalytic performance of
PdAg NDs for EOR in alkaline solution. Their cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve was first collected in N2-saturated 1 m KOH
(Figure 4a). The pronounced cathode peak between −0.5 and
−0.1 V (versus saturated calomel electrode or SCE, the same

hereafter) during the negative sweep corresponded to the
reduction of surface PdO to metallic Pd.[6,22,23] CV curve of pure
Ag was featureless within this potential region (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Based on the integrated charge associated
with this cathodic peak, we estimated that the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of PdAg NDs was 69.5 m2 g−1
(normalized to the amount of Pd). This value was considerably
larger than those of commercially available 30 wt% Pd nanoparticles supported on Vulcan carbon black (Pd/C, 30.6 m2 g−1),
3D Pd nanodendrites free of any Ag (Pd NDs, 35.2 m2 g−1) and
most previous Pd-based materials,[6,24–27] thereby highlighting
the unique structural advantage of PdAg NDs.
With the addition of 1 m ethanol to the electrolyte, all CV
curves were drastically changed due to EOR electrocatalysis.
They exhibited an intense and broad anodic wave during the
forward scan that was typically attributed to the electroxidation
of ethanol to intermediate products, and a relatively narrower
anodic wave during the reverse scan that was usually attributed
to the further oxidation of intermediate products (Figure 4b).
Since Ag alone was known to have low EOR activity (Figure S1,
Supporting Information) and the observed activity was mostly
contributed by Pd, we normalized the electrocatalytic current
with respect to the Pd mass so as to allow side-by-side comparison across different electrocatalysts. Among the three
materials under study, PdAg NDs exhibited the highest peak
specific current of ≈2600 mA mg−1, substantially larger than
those of Pd NDs (≈1900 mA mg−1) and Pd/C (≈1600 mA mg−1).
It was also much improved over values reported in literature
(Table S2, Supporting Information).[24,28–33]
One of the most severe challenges confronting the development of EOR electrocatalysts was their poor operation durability

Figure 4. Electrochemical measurements of PdAg NDs for EOR. a) CV curve of PdAg NDs in 1 m KOH solution; b) CV curves of PdAg NDs, Pd NDs,
and commercial 30 wt% Pd/C in 1 m ethanol containing 1 m KOH; c) EOR cycling stability curves of PdAg NDs, Pd NDs, and Pd/C; d) EOR chronoamperometric stability curves of PdAg NDs, Pd NDs, and Pd/C. Specific currents in (c,d) were measured at −0.2 V versus SCE.

due to the rapid buildup of carbonaceous poisons.[4] It was
therefore our main focus to study the stability of PdAg NDs,
as approached by the following two methods. First, the cycling
stability of PdAg NDs was assessed by continuously running CV cycles between −0.9−0.2 V at 50 mV s-1. The specific
current at −0.2 V during the forward scan was then periodically extracted and plotted against the cycle number (Figure 4c).
We could see that the specific current of Pd NDs and Pd/C
quickly declined from ≈1600 mA mg-1 to virtually zero after
the first 2000 cycles – a performance typical to many Pd-based
EOR electrocatalyst. By sharp contrast, the activity loss of
PdAg NDs during continuous cycling was significantly milder,
with a specific current of 1200 mA mg-1 retained even after
10 000 cycles. Second, the chronoamperometric (i∼t) stability of
PdAg NDs was evaluated by monitoring the change of electrocatalytic current at −0.2 V. Chronoamperometric stability was usually
more stringent because it reflected the electrocatalyst deactivation under the continuous working environment. A similar
trend was observed here: both Pd NDs and Pd/C showed a fast
activity loss and became almost inactive after 1000 s, whereas
AgPd NDs retained a specific current of ≈780 mA mg-1 after
10 000 s electrocatalysis. The measured cycling stability and
chronoamperometric stability of our PdAg NDs were remarkable and could be matched by few competitors in literature
(Table S2, Supporting Information).[6,24,28–35] To gain insight
on the improved stability, we further carried out CO stripping
experiments. CO was suggested as the primary surface poison
during EOR electrocatalysis. Figure S2 in the Supporting Information summarized the results for PdAg NDs, Pd NDs, and
Pd/C. Anodic waves at >−0.6 V in the first cycle were due to the
electroxidation of adsorbed CO to CO2 on Pd. Compared to Pd
NDs and commercial Pd/C, the anodic wave of PdAg NDs was
markedly displaced to lower potential. This data ambiguously
suggested that the CO adsorption was significantly weakened
on PdAg NDs.
We believed that the superior EOR performance of PdAg
NDs was a combined result of the synergistic electronic effect
and their advantageous nanostructure. Alloying Pd with Ag
effectively modified its electronic structure and probably weakened the binding between Pd and the poisonous adsorbate.[4,5]
This was attested by the much enhanced stability of PdAg NDs
relative to Pd NDs. We also compared alloy nanodendrites with
different compositions and found that a nominal Pd/Ag ratio
of 1 yielded the best EOR performance. Introducing more or
less Ag compromised the electrocatalytic stability (Figure S3,
Supporting Information). On the other hand, the 2D nanodendritic structure provided enlarged surface area and abundant
undercoordinated sites for EOR. This structural effect could be
unambiguously manifested by our control experiment showing
that porous PdAg nanoparticles with the same Pd/Ag ratio but
prepared at 40 °C exhibited significantly inferior performance
(Figure S4, Supporting Information).
In summary, 2D PdAg alloy nanodendrites were facilely prepared via the coreduction of Pd and Ag precursors in aqueous
solution with the presence of OTAC. They featured small thickness (5–7 nm) and random in-plane branching. Such a highly
anisotropic structure was achieved through the assistance of the
cationic surfactant with a long alkyl chain as well as the careful
control of a few synthetic parameters. PdAg NDs demonstrated

Adv. Mater. 2018, 1706962

remarkable electrocatalytic activity and stability for EOR in
alkaline solution. In particular, our stability evaluation revealed
that under the cycling test, a specific current of 1200 mA mg-1
was retained even after 10 000 cycles; under the chronoamperometric test at −0.2 V, a specific current of ≈780 mA mg-1 was
retained after 10 000 s electrocatalysis. The enhanced EOR performance was understood as a result of the synergistic coupling
between Pd and Ag in the alloy and the unique 2D dendritic
nanostructure. Our synthetic strategy for high-quality 2D nano­
dendrites could be readily extended to other alloy systems,
which would be reported elsewhere.

Experimental Section
Preparation of PdAg NDs: In a typical synthesis, 2 mL of 0.01 m H2PdCl4
and 2 mL of 0.01 m AgNO3 were sequentially added to 200 mL of 0.01 m
OTAC aqueous solution. After bath-sonicated for 10 min, the solution
was added with 4 mL of 0.1 m ascorbic acid solution and allowed to react
at 20 oC for 2 h without agitation. Alloys with different compositions
could be achieved by varying the starting Pd/Ag molar ratio. Pure Ag
was collected at the same condition without H2PdCl4 at 60 oC 2 h. Solid
products were collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm and repetitively
washed. They were then redispersed in water, quickly frozen using liquid
N2, and immediately transferred to a lyophilizer (Telstar LYOQUEST-55
operating at a pressure of 0.2 mbar and condenser temperature of −73 °C)
for lyophilization overnight.
Structural Characterizations: TEM images were collected on Hitachi
HT7700 transmission electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of
120 kV for low-magnification images, and on FEI Tecnai F20 transmission
electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV for highresolution TEM images, SEAD pattern and elemental mapping. XRD was
carried out on X′Pert-Pro MPD diffractometer with a Cu Kα X-ray source.
XPS spectra were obtained from Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray
photoelectron spectrometer. ICP analysis was conducted on Varian
710-ES inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer. AFM
was performed on Bruker Dimension Icon atomic force microscope and
analyzed with the software of NanoScope Analysis.
Electrochemical Measurements: Electrochemical experiments were
carried out in a standard three-electrode system controlled by a CHI
660E potentiostat. A glassy-carbon electrode (3 mm in diameter), an
SCE, and a graphite rod were used as the working-, reference-, and
counterelectrode, respectively. 1 mg of PdAg NDs and 2 mg oxidized
multiwalled carbon nanotubes (as the conductive additive) were
dispersed in 375 µL of ethanol and 375 µL of deionized water, added
with 18 µL of 5 wt% Nafion solution, and vigorously sonicated for
30 min to form a uniform ink. Subsequently, 5 µL of the catalyst ink
was drop-cast onto the glassy carbon electrode and dried naturally.
Before EOR measurements, electrocatalysts were first activated in N2saturated 1 m KOH by CV cycling between −1.0 and 0.2 V versus SCE
at a scan rate of 200 mV s-1 for about 50 cycles. CV curves in 1 m
KOH with or without 1 m ethanol were then collected at 20 mV s-1.
ECSA was estimated from the CV curve in 1 m KOH using the following
equation
ECSA =

QPdO

0.405 mC cm−2 × mPd

(1)

where QPdO was the charge by integrating the reduction peak area of PdO
to Pd, mPd was the Pd mass on the working electrode as determined by
ICP, and 0.405 mC cm-2 was the charge required for the reduction of
PdO monolayer. CO stripping experiments were conducted in 1 m KOH.
The electrolyte was first bubbled with 10% CO/N2, while the potential
of catalyst was held at −1.0 V for 30 min, during which CO monolayer
adsorption was developed on the Pd surface. Nonadsorbed CO was then

expelled from the electrolyte by bubbling the solution with N2 for 15 min.
Immediately afterward, CV cycles were performed with an initial anodic
sweep in the potential range of −1.0–0.2 V at 10 mV s-1 for at least two
consecutive cycles.

In the present study, aluminium metal matrix composites (AMCs) were successfully produced through
stir-squeeze casting using a novel approach. The feasibility of using car scrap aluminium alloy wheels
(SAAWs) as the matrix material and spent alumina catalyst (SAC) from oil reﬁneries as reinforcement
material was investigated. For the purpose of comparision, composites were also produced using
AlSi7Mg (LM25 grade) aluminium alloy as a matrix and alumina as reinforcement particles through the
stir-squeeze casting process. In total, four different combinations of composites (AlSi7Mg þ alumina;
scrap aluminium alloy þ alumina; AlSi7Mg þ spent alumina catalyst; scrap aluminium alloy þ spent
alumina catalyst) were produced and characterized. Microstructural investigations using an optical
microscope and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) as well as energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed that in all four composites the reinforcement formed a
mixture in the eutectic silicon phase of the matrix alloy. The alumina particles' size and content ratio
greatly inﬂuenced this mixture's formation and morphology. The composites produced using alumina
exhibited smaller pore sizes and lower porosity as compared to the composites produced with a spent
alumina catalyst. Superior mechanical properties were also obtained when using alumina as reinforcement, and better mechanical properties can mainly be attributed to the morphology of the reinforcement
and silicon eutectic phase mixture. The scrap aluminium alloy þ alumina exhibited the lowest porosity
(7.3%) and abrasive wear loss (0.11 mg for the ﬁnest abrasive), highest hardness (58.5 BHN), and second
highest ultimate tensile strength (UTS) (125 MPa) and ultimate compressive strength (UCS) (312 MPa)
among the four composites.

1. Introduction
Aluminum is widely available in the Earth's crust and accounts
for about 8% by weight of the Earth's stable surface. Its properties,
such as high strength-to-weight ratio, ductility, durability, etc., and
abundant availability have attracted researchers and caused industries to prefer it. For these reasons, global aluminum demand

has increased [1]. By 2020, worldwide consumption of aluminum
products is expected to double, driven by the growth and industrialization in China, India, Russia, and Brazil according to Alcoa's
2005 Annual Report. Fuel savings of 5e7% can be realized for every
10% weight reduction by substituting aluminum for heavier steel
through appropriate design [2]. Although aluminum exhibits a high
strength-to-weight ratio, it can be further improved by adding reinforcements such as ceramic particles resulting in a metal matrix
composite (MMC). The synthesis of cast aluminum metal matrix
composite with ceramic particles reinforcement dates back to 1965

when Pradeep Rohatgi discovered it [3]. Since then, many researchers have investigated the development and characterization
of metal matrix composites. Over the past three decades, metal
matrix composites have moved from research to commercial applications. The worldwide metal matrix composite markets as of
2004 required more than 3500 metric tons and are increasing
rapidly, with an annual growth rate exceeding 6% [3]. Metal matrix
composites' functional properties, including high structural efﬁciency, excellent wear resistance, and attractive thermal and electrical characteristics, have enabled their application in ground
transportation, including auto and rail; thermal management; and
the aerospace, recreational, and infrastructure industries [4]. Metal
matrix composites have also been commercialized in a large
number of high-performance applications [3]. Currently, metal
matrix composites are used in automotive applications, including
in cylinder liners, pistons, connecting rods, camshafts, tappets,
brake calipers and rotors, and much more. However, the cost of
these high-performance components is still high, and they are not
widely used. Several approaches could be taken to reduce the cost
of composites such as single-step mixing, opting for selective reinforcements, and using cheaper reinforcements [5]. A few researchers in Oman have investigated using spent catalyst waste for
producing building materials, but the added value of such applications is quite low when compared to using the waste in highperformance applications such as in components for automotive
industries [6,7]. Spent alumina catalyst, for example, mainly consists of alumina (71.38 wt %) so could be easily used as a reinforcement for producing aluminum metal matrix composite
reinforced with alumina [6]. Around 200e500 kg of waste spent
alumina catalyst is produced daily in oil reﬁneries in Oman and
pose an environmental threat [6].
Aluminium production involves very high energy consumption
because its production is based on an electrolytic reduction process
involving very high current [8]. It has been estimated that 20e40%
of the cost of production can be accounted for by the electric power
consumed during production [9]. Hence, the present approach is
environmentally friendly because scrap aluminium alloy wheels
were used as the matrix material for producing aluminum metal
matrix composite. It has been suggested that recycling aluminum
could eliminate more than 94% of the impact of global warming and
fossil fuel depletion as compared to producing aluminium as a
primary processes [8]. Also, transmuting waste materials into
value-added composite materials to be used for different applications results in the conservation of natural resources. Economic
beneﬁts also result from the reduced cost associated with using
scrap materials.
Aluminum metal matrix composites are normally produced by
the established route of stir casting [10]. Although stir casting is an
economical process for producing casted components, they suffer
from porosity issues, which prevents their use for producing highstrength components. To overcome this issue, researchers have
adopted squeeze casting. Among the metal matrix composites
produced, aluminum and silicon carbide (SiC) are the most
commonly investigated matrix and reinforcement materials,
respectively [11,12]. Although alumina (Al2O3) exhibits similar
properties, researchers have made relatively few attempts to
develop metal matrix composites using alumina as compared to
SiC. Two different metal matrix composites with the matrixreinforcement combinations of Al6061-SiC (20 mm) and Al7075alumina (20 mm) have been produced through stir casting [12]. The
researchers recommended particle reinforced composites over ﬁber reinforced ones for the advantages of lower cost and better
plastic forming capability as well as excellent heat and wear
resistance. The Al7075- alumina composite was found to exhibit
better mechanical properties than Al6061-SiC because the Al7075

matrix was found to possess better mechanical properties than the
Al6061. Sajjadi and Beygi produced aluminum metal matrix composites reinforced with both micro and nano alumina particles
using a bottom tapping squeeze casting facility [13]. Even though
nanoparticle-reinforced metal matrix composites exhibited better
mechanical properties, they had issues of agglomeration while the
micron particles were uniformly dispersed in the matrix. Sajjadi
and co-workers [14] investigated the microstructure and mechanical properties of aluminium - alumina micro and nanocomposites
produced by squeeze casting. The researchers adopted a novel
three-step mixing method that helped to improve the incorporation and uniform distribution of the nano reinforcement particles.
Best mechanical properties were obtained at smaller alumina particle sizes. Yigezu and co-workers compared the performance of an
aluminium alloy (AlCu4Mg2.5) reinforced with both alumina
(50 mm) and SiC (50 mm) metal matrix composite produced by stir
casting [15]. In terms of mechanical properties like UTS, the SiCreinforced composite performed better than the alumina
although in terms of ductility the alumina performed better. This
trend can mainly be attributed to the ductile nature of the fracture
in the alumina-reinforced composite, while in the SiC-reinforced
composite the weak intermetallic phase Al4C3 formed resulted in
brittle fractures. Abhishek and co-workers produced and characterized a A359/alumina metal matrix composite using an electromagnetic squeeze casting method [16]. The tensile strength of the
cast composites increased with the increase in the weight fraction
of alumina. Tahamtan and co-workers studied the effects of
alumina reinforcing particle size (10 mm and 100 nm) in an Al-A206
matrix produced through semi-solid and liquid states [17]. The
reinforcement was added in two different forms: as received
alumina particles and in a pre-synthesized composite that was
prepared by milling alumina with aluminium and magnesium
powders. The researchers recommended adding the reinforcement
in pre-synthesized forms rather than as received because the
thinner interfacial reaction layer has been found to produce better
tensile properties. Also, the researchers found that composites
produced through a liquid state exhibited higher porosity when
compared to the semi-solid state. In the liquid state during stirring,
the vortex formed created turbulence which resulted in the
entrapment of air resulting in higher porosity. The nanometer
reinforced alumina exhibited better ultimate tensile strength (UTS)
when compared to the micron-sized reinforced composite because
of the fracture occurring through particle debonding. Heat treatment of 1 wt % of alumina in aluminum metal matrix composites
resulted in signiﬁcant improvement in mechanical properties such
as hardness and compressive strength [18]. Similar to the work of
Kumar and co-workers Lakshmipathy and co-workers produced
metal matrix composites through stir casting but changed the
matrix combinations to 7075Al/SiC and 6061Al/alumina [12,19].
The researchers mainly focused on the reciprocating wear behavior
of metal matrix composites with three different reinforcement
weight percentages (10, 15, and 20%) of SiC and Al2O3 having a size
of 36 mm. An increase in the weight percentage of reinforcements
resulted in higher hardness but the impact strength decreased.
Maximum hardness of 50 Brinell hardness number (BHN) was
recorded for the Al7075-20%SiC while the Al6061-20% alumina
exhibited a lower value (37 BHN). Similarly, the wear resistance of
Al7075-SiC composites was greater than that of Al6061- alumina
which was mainly due to the lower volume loss because Al7075's
matrix had a higher hardness. Microsized SiC and alumina have also
been used together as reinforcement in aluminum metal matrix
composites at different proportions to improve mechanical properties [20].
Based on the literature reviewed, all research on producing
aluminum metal matrix composites by squeeze casting has used

virgin matrices and reinforcement materials. This proposed
research approach is novel, therefore, because for the ﬁrst time
aluminum metal matrix composite was produced using scrap
aluminium alloy as a matrix and spent alumina catalyst from oil
reﬁnery waste as reinforcement material. The scrap aluminium
alloy (chemical formula: AlSi4Mg3Mn2Fe1) closely resembled
6000-series aluminum alloy, with the most prevalent alloying elements being silicon, magnesium, manganese, and iron. The
chemical composition is illustrated in Table 1. For comparision
purposes, both virgin aluminium alloy grade AlSi7Mg and alumina
were used as matrix and reinforcement materials, respectively. In
this research work, four different aluminum metal matrix composites were produced using a squeeze-casting process and subjected to both material and mechanical property characterizations
using different techniques.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Matrix and reinforcement materials
AlSi7Mg alloy billets and aluminium from scrap aluminium alloy
were selected as matrix materials, and alumina and spent alumina
catalyst were selected as reinforcing materials for developing the
composites. The elemental composition of scrap aluminium alloy
and spent alumina catalyst (Table 1) was determined through X-ray
ﬂuorescence (XRF) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)
analysis, respectively [6]. The alumina powder (Alfa Aesar, Germany) was of high chemical purity with an average particle size of
50 mm. The spent alumina catalyst was obtained from the local
petroleum reﬁnery and had an average particle size of 150 mm.
2.2. Metal matrix composite production
Squeeze casting was utilized to produce the composites. The
composition of the materials used for producing the aluminum
metal matrix composites is shown in Table 2. The scrap aluminium
alloy was collected from scrap stock, and dirt and grease were
removed using acetone. The wheels were cut into small pieces so
that they could easily pass through the opening of the crucible. The
permanent hardened steel dies (50 mm in diameter and 250 mm
long) were preheated to 300  C. The temperature-controlled
squeeze casting furnace was set to 750  C. The stirrer rod and
stirrer were cleaned, and a non-stick boron carbide coating was
applied at room temperature and dried at 250e300  C to withstand
high temperatures and prevent erosion of the stirrer edges. The
reinforcement particles were preheated in the preheater chamber
at 300  C to eliminate dampness and reduce particle clotting. The
matrix materials were charged into the furnace when the crucible
temperature reached around 350  C, and the materials were further
heated to 750  C to completely melt the alloy. The stirrer rod was
then switched on and gently moved into a position 30 mm above
the bottom of the crucible with a stirring speed of 650 rpm. One wt.
% of magnesium was added to the molten matrix to improve the

wettability between the matrix and the reinforcement [21]. The
preheated reinforcement particles were slowly added to the vortex
formed during stirring and mixed for 10 min. The molten mixture
was then transferred through a bottom tapping mechanism into the
preheated pathway pipe connected to the die of the squeeze casting
setup. A squeezing pressure of 200 MPa was applied immediately to
the molten mixture poured into the die. The same procedure was
followed for the fabrication of the remaining three samples. The
procedure used for producing the aluminum metal matrix composites is shown in Scheme 1. The squeeze casting parameters for
aluminum metal matrix composite fabrication are in Table 3.
2.3. Microstructural and elemental composition characterization
The samples obtained through squeeze casting were cut to the
required size and then mounted using a SimpliMet 1000 automated
mounting press (Buehler, USA). An Automet 250 grinder-polisher
(Buehler) was used for grinding and polishing the samples.
Grinding was accomplished sequentially using 400, 600, and 1200
grit abrasive paper. Samples were then mechanically polished for
ﬁve minutes with three stages of diamond suspension. Per ASTM
E3-01, the ﬁnely polished samples were etched using Keller's reagent. The surface morphological analysis was carried out using an
optical microscope 1000x VHZ100R (Keyence Corporation, Japan).
The microstructures and elemental composition of the samples as
well as the fracture and wear analyses were studied using a ﬁeld
emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) model JSM-7600F
(JEOL, Japan) with an attached EDS. X-ray diffraction analyses were
conducted using an X'pert PRO XRD (Malvern Panalytical Ltd., UK)
with Cu Ka radiation (l ¼ 1.5418 Å) to measure intensities of the
peak and identify the different phases of the material. X-ray ﬂuorescence analyses were conducted for scrap aluminium alloy
composition analysis using an AxiosmAX (Panalytical).
2.4. Porosity and speciﬁc strength measurement
The density of the matrix and reinforcement were determined
to assess the percentage of porosities present in the aluminum
metal matrix composites. Density measurements were executed
based on Archimedes' principle using a 10-mm wide x 30-mm long
x 3-mm thick sample for all four composites. The theoretical densities of composites were calculated using the rule of mixtures [22].

The speciﬁc strength, or strength-to-weight ratio of the
aluminum metal matrix composites, was calculated by the forceper-unit area at failure divided by its experimental density.

2.5. Mechanical and wear characterization
Samples' hardness, and compressive, tensile, and abrasive
properties were evaluated. Hardness was measured with a universal hardness tester UH250 (Buehler) using the indentation
technique. The Brinell and Vickers scales of hardness were used,
and the average of ﬁve repeated measurements at random locations were reported. A force of 15.625 kgf was applied to determine
the BHN using a 2.5 mm ball indenter gradually applied to the
substrate without impact with a dwell time of six seconds. Similarly, to determine the Vickers hardness value (HV) a force of 5 kgf
was applied to the substrate using a square-based diamond pyramid indenter with an included angle of 136 for a dwell time of
eight seconds. Three samples were prepared from each produced
aluminum metal matrix composite rod for tensile tests per ASTM
B557 using a wire-cutting machine. Gripping the specimen at the
two ends, the tensile load was applied. Using the stress-strain curve
obtained from the machine, mechanical properties such as yield

and ultimate stress of the samples were calculated. The strain rate
of the tensile test was 8.33  104/s. A compression test was carried
out according to ASTM E9 using a 100 kN universal testing machine
(MTS 20/MH, France). The uniaxial compression tests were performed on 20 mm high by 12 mm in diameter cylindrical samples
with a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min (a strain rate of about
8.33  104/s). Two samples for each of the four composites were
then tested using a compression test. Each sample was compressed
to 10 mm (half its height), and the load-stroke data were converted
to stress-strain curves. An abrasion test was performed on polished
substrate using a two-body TR-605 abrasion tester (Ducom Instruments, India). Four different grades of SiC emery paper (ES20,
ES60, D-150, and SiC E4 600 TP4) were used with ANSI grit sizes of
20, 60, 150, and 600, respectively, with SiC E4 600 TP4 exhibiting
the ﬁnest grit. A friction wheel of precisely deﬁned dimensions held
down by a known weight was moved to and fro in a straight line
across the test surface. The outer diameter of the wheel was 50 mm
greater than the diameter of the surface to which the emery paper
was ﬁxed. In this process, the rubbing segment of the wheel was
constantly replaced by lifting the wheel off the surface and turning
it to a ﬁxed angle of 1.8 at the end of each stroke. The wheel started
rubbing against the squeeze cast sample at 40 rpm with a test load
of 3N. The reciprocating motion of the assembly delivered uniform
abrasion to the specimen. The motor was turned off automatically
after completing 200 cycles. The weight loss of the samples was
measured using a weighing machine with a minimum count of
0.001 g.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Microstructural analysis
The optical microscopic images for the four different composites
at 200 magniﬁcation are shown in Fig. 1. In the pictures, grey
particles are a mixture of both the reinforcement and the eutectic
phase of silicon, white regions are aluminium matrix, and black
regions are porous defects. All microstructures exhibited an almost
non-dendrite shape at the grain boundaries because of the squeeze

pressure, which resulted in ﬁner dendrites and decreased dendrite
arm spacing [23]. Fig. 1(a) and (b) show that the microstructure of
the composites with alumina used as a reinforcement have nearly
uniform dispersion and dense structure with the exception of some
of the micropores [Fig. 1(a)]. This ﬁnding was reconﬁrmed by the
pore size and distribution (Fig. 2). Although small clusters of mixed
particles from the alumina and silicon eutectic phase (explained in
detail using Figs. S1 and S2 in the supporting information) can be

aluminium alloy wheel; SAC: spent alumina catalyst).

observed in some regions [Fig. 1(a)], a uniform distribution of
particles can also be observed [Fig. 1(b)]. The clustering can be
attributed to the smaller size of the alumina reinforcement when
compared to the spent alumina catalyst. The uniform distribution
of the mixed particles at the grain boundaries may also be attributed to the smaller grain size, with an average ranging from 42 to
50 mm of both matrix materials. However, the slightly smaller size
of the AlSi7Mg matrix resulted in more uniform particle distribution when compared to the scrap aluminium alloy matrix. Table 4
shows the grain sizes obtained for all four composites. The methodology for estimating the grain sizes is explained in the
supporting information with the help of Fig. S3. Fig. 1(aed) shows
that the grain boundaries were occupied by the mixed particles of
alumina and the Si eutectic phase [24,25]. The mixed particles were
mostly positioned in the grain boundary cavities [25]. During the
solidiﬁcation process, alumina particles dissipated heat slowly
compared with the matrix due to the lower thermal and heat
diffusivity of alumina, and the liquid alloy cooled down more
rapidly than the particles. In addition, the hotter particles may have
transferred heat to the surrounding materials, resulting in a slower
melt which may have caused delayed solidiﬁcation. As a result,
nucleation of the aluminium phase started in the liquid at a distance from the particles, where the temperature was lower.
Therefore, the microstructure of the composites contained primary
aluminium dendrites and eutectic silicon, while alumina particles
were separated at the inter-dendritic regions. This event occurred
more easily with the ﬁner particles [13]. The scrap aluminium
alloy þ spent alumina catalyst and AlSi7Mg þ spent alumina
catalyst composites [Fig. 1(c) and (d)] clearly show that the addition
of spent alumina catalyst to the aluminum matrix produced
porosity in the samples. Spent alumina catalyst particles entrapped
air [(as shown schematically in the top left corner of Fig. 1(d)],

leading to difficulty in their integration into the melt. These
agglomerated spent alumina catalyst particles entered into the
melt and caused porosity [(shown as an inset in the lower left
corner of Fig. 1(d)] and agglomeration of spent alumina catalyst
particles in the composite [26]. Similar results were observed in an
earlier publication where some porosity was found to be usual in
aluminum metal matrix composites [27]. This ﬁnding was attributed to the longer particle feeding time, which increased the time
of contact with air.
Fig. 2 shows the pore size distribution for the four composites
based on analysis of the optical micrograph images (Fig. 1) [28].
Fig. S4 in the supporting information describes the procedure
adopted to ﬁnd the pore size and distribution. Fig. 2 shows that
micropores (0e25 mm) constituted more than 80% of the pores in
the composites, and less than 20% of the pores were over 100 mm in
size. The larger size pores (>100 mm) were only found in composites
reinforced with spent alumina catalyst (Table S2 in the supporting
information shows the size ranges and number of pores). The air
entrapment mechanism detailed in Fig. 1(d) explains why the pore
sizes as well as the number of pores are higher in the spent alumina
catalyst reinforced composites. The fractured surfaces of the composites reinforced with spent alumina catalyst (Fig. 10) indicate
poor wettability with the matrix, resulting in pore nucleation of the
surfaces and larger pore sizes as well as higher porosity in the
matrix reinforced with spent alumina catalyst [14]. In the case of
the scrap aluminium alloy þ alumina composite, 100% of the pores
are in the 0e25 mm range and it is only one pore (Table S2). Similarly, AlSi7Mg þ alumina also exhibited smaller pore sizes and
fewer pores (Table S2). The pore distribution data was consistent
with the porosity volume percentage reported in Fig. 5A.
Fig. 3 shows the ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscope
images of the four composite samples at 300 magniﬁcation. The
distribution of reinforcement in the matrix of the composite is
visible in the micrograph. The light and dark grey particles are the
reinforcement and matrix, respectively. The microstructure of both
matrix materials (AlSi7Mg and scrap aluminium alloy) consisted of
primary a phase aluminum dendrites and eutectic silicon [13]. The
alumina particles were separated at the inter-dendritic regions and
in the eutectic silicon so appeared as a mixture [29]. This mixture is
evident in the zoomed area shown as the inset of Fig. 3(a), which
shows that the eutectic silicon phase morphology is mostly a
mixture of slightly acicular spherical structures and some blunted,
needle-like shapes as well. This type of morphology, and especially
the spherical and blunted needle shapes, reduces the stress concentration, enhancing mechanical properties as can be seen from
the ultimate tensile strength values discussed later [30,31]. The
smaller size as well as the higher alumina content as compared to
the spent alumina catalyst provided more nucleation sites for the
eutectic silicon phase. Moreover, the higher-content silicon in the
AlSi7Mg alloy resulted in a denser mixture in the eutectic silicon
phase and the reinforcement [Fig. 3(a) and (c)].
The scanning electron micrographs [Fig. 3(a) and (b)] show that
the alumina reinforcement particles mixed with the eutectic silicon
appeared well dispersed in the matrix, although some small clusters remained in the microstructure of AlSi7Mg þ alumina

[Fig. 3(a)]. This ﬁnding can mainly be attributed to the smaller size
of the alumina reinforcement, which tends to aggregate due to high
surface energy [32]. Fig. 3(c) and (d) depicting AlSi7Mg þ spent
alumina catalyst and scrap aluminium alloy þ spent alumina
catalyst composites also show a uniform distribution of reinforcements throughout the sample but with micropores.
Fig. 3(d)'s inset shows micropores. These porosities are mainly due
to the larger size of the spent alumina catalyst particles (150 mm)
which act as nucleation sites for the pores. Also, as explained
earlier, the spent alumina catalyst particles entrap air which leads
to micropores around the reinforcement particles [Fig. 1(d)].
X-ray diffraction analysis was carried out for phase identiﬁcation and to measure peak intensity. Fig. 4 shows the X-ray diffraction analyses of the four samples. All four patterns show that the
highest intensity peaks were for the aluminium matrix (38.66 ) and
the alumina reinforcement (44.42 ). The other alloying elements
present in elevated amounts, such as the silicon, magnesium, and
iron present in the matrix material, also appeared as low intensity
peaks. The aluminum peaks were in the (1 1 1) and (2 2 0) planes
while, for alumina, the peaks were in the (2 0 2) plane. Similarly, the
planes for silicon, silicon dioxide (SiO2), magnesium, and iron were
silicon (1 1 1), silicon (2 2 0), SiO2 (3 1 1), magnesium (2 1 1) and iron
(2 1 1), respectively. These peaks were identiﬁed using Xpert
HighScore software (Malvern Panalytical) and peaks were matched
with the International Centre for Diffraction Data (ICDD) database.
The peaks were high enough to prove that the materials were
polycrystalline in nature and that the particles were arranged in
cubic order. The structure of atoms was arranged in a hexagonal
closed packed system and packed highly efﬁciently. This ﬁnding
may be attributed to the pressure applied during squeeze casting
[33].
The composite using AlSi7Mg grade as a matrix material had
signiﬁcant silicon content which was indicated by the relatively
higher intensity peaks [Fig. 4(a) and (c)]. Although the silicon
content was higher in the AlSi7Mg grade, the absence of new
phases with silicon indicated no adverse reactions. Similarly, the
slightly higher intensity peaks of magnesium and iron in the
composites based on the scrap aluminium alloy did not indicate any
adverse reactions with either the alumina [Fig. 4(b)] or spent
alumina catalyst [Fig. 4(d)]. The inactivity of iron in the matrix may
be attributed to the levels below the critical iron level, so no ironcontaining intermetallic phases were formed [34]. The X-ray
diffraction pattern of the AlSi7Mg and alumina combination
[Fig. 4(a)] showed higher intensity peaks for alumina because it has
higher alumina content as compared to the composite produced
using spent alumina catalyst as reinforcement (~70% alumina).
Similar higher intensity peaks for alumina were also obtained
[Fig. 4(b)] because of the higher alumina content. Similarly, the Xray diffraction patterns [Fig. 4(a) and (b)] in which alumina was
used as a reinforcement did not reveal any new phase formation
with the aluminum in the matrix and so was quite stable. This
stability may be attributed to the compatability of the alumina with
the aluminium matrix. A similar trend was also noted [Fig. 4(c) and
(d)] in samples where spent alumina catalyst was used as the
reinforcement. The patterns indicate the absence of high levels of

new phase formation. The composite with alumina reinforcement
produced higher peak intensity [Fig. 4(a) and (b)] when compared
to the spent alumina catalyst phase [Fig. 4(c) and (d)]. The higher
alumina content was a main cause of the improved mechanical
strength of the composite, and the trend matched the tensile and
compressive properties discussed later.
3.2. Porosity and speciﬁc strength
Porosity affects the properties of materials based on pore size,
distribution of reinforcements, and other characteristics. It is
almost impossible to completely avoid porosity in aluminium
castings because shrinkage results from volume contraction that
occurs during solidiﬁcation as well as gas evolution. This phenomenon is due to a decrease in the gas solubility of solid metal as
compared to the liquid form [35]. In addition to the porosity formed
due to shrinkage and gas evolution, adding reinforcement particles
also increases the sites for pore formation; thus, composites exhibit
higher porosity than pure matrix materials. Generally, if porosity is
low, fewer empty spaces are found in the composite material, and it
will be stronger. In the current study, the calculated porosity results
matched the obtained optical micrograph. The scrap aluminium
alloy þ alumina composite sample showed much lower porosity
while samples with spent alumina catalyst reinforcement exhibited
higher porosity (Fig. 5). The higher silicon content in the AlSi7Mg
matrix resulted in more nucleation sites around the reinforcement,
so the frequency of micropores was higher when compared to the
scrap aluminium alloy, which had a lower silicon content. In the
squeeze casting process, the higher pressure used during solidiﬁcation aided in proper ﬁlling of the die, reducing casting defects and
especially those related to porosity. This phenomenon is illustrated
in the experimental density obtained and illustrated in Fig. 5(A).

The squeeze casting process was quite successful in achieving
experimental density close to the theoretical density [36]. The
higher porosity in the case of spent alumina catalyst may be
attributed to the nature of its application. Spent alumina catalyst is
mainly used to reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) to the atmosphere [37]. These volatile compounds present
in the spent alumina catalyst contribute to the higher porosity. The
mechanism of the gas entrapment was discussed earlier [Fig. 1 (d)].
Fig. 5(B) shows that the strength-to-weight ratio of the
AlSi7Mg þ alumina aluminum metal matrix composite was highest
followed by the scrap aluminium alloy þ alumina aluminum metal
matrix composite. Although the AlSi7Mg þ alumina composite
exhibited higher porosity than the scrap aluminium
alloy þ alumina, it showed the highest speciﬁc strength, which was
due to a higher concentration of the acicular shaped eutectic silicon
phase mixture that acted as a barrier for dislocation movement in
the matrix [30,38].
3.3. Hardness
Fig. 6 shows the hardness values on both the Brinell and Vicker
scales for all four composites. The Brinell hardness values correlated well with the ultimate tensile strength values discussed in the
next section. The two tests were conducted by indentation where
the indenter was pressed into the sample under speciﬁc standard
force. However, a steel ball indenter was used in the Bricknell test
while a square-base diamond pyramid indenter was used in the
Vickers test. The Vicker hardness values were highly inﬂuenced by
the location of the indentation because of the instrument's sharp
tip, possibly explaining the reason for the Vicker hardness values
not being well correlated with the tensile strength of the composites. This feature of instrumentation is the reason for the

observed scattering in the Vicker hardness values; thus, the Brinell
hardness test is recommended for bulk composites with micronsized reinforcement particles.

The BHN values obtained for the four composites did not vary to
a great degree (Table 4). However, a trend can be inferred based on
the values obtained for the four composites. The highest hardness
was found in the AlSi7Mg þ alumina composite (58.8 BHN) followed very closely by the scrap aluminium alloy þ alumina composite (58.5 BHN). The hardness for the AlSi7Mg þ spent alumina
catalyst composite was 57.7 BHN followed by 56 BHN for the scrap
aluminium alloy þ spent alumina catalyst composite. The higher
BHNs for the alumina-based reinforcements were mainly due to the
smaller size of the alumina particles as compared to the spent
alumina catalyst. It can also be inferred that the smaller grain size of
the AlSi7Mg matrix contributed to the higher hardness values obtained (Table 4). With the decrease in grain size, the hardness of the
material increased [39]. The porosity also inﬂuenced the hardness,
and the data show that the scrap aluminium alloy þ spent alumina
catalyst composite had the highest porosity and the lowest hardness, because the porosity sites acted as microsites for easy dislocation movement [Table 4].

Table 5 shows a comparison of the hardness and porosity values
for composites produced by different researchers primarily using
alumina as the main reinforcement by the stir/squeeze casting
processes. Because the matrix materials, size, types of reinforcement and percentages used are quite different for the composites
reported, each ﬁnding is unique; therefore, it is quite difﬁcult to
compare previous ﬁndings with those of the present work. However, in general the hardness as well as the porosity values obtained
in this work are comparable with those in the literature. The
hardness values in brackets were converted from different scales to
the BHN scale for comparison purposes using a hardness conversion chart for aluminium [40]. This conversion, however, must be
regarded as only an estimate for research purposes. Table 5 shows
that the particle size (ranging from 10 to 70 mm) and porosity
(ranging from 2.9 to 11%) inﬂuenced the hardness signiﬁcantly. The
smaller particle sizes provided more interfacial area, which served
as the nucleation site for grain formation. When the particle size is
smaller, the spacing between the particles is reduced. The smaller
particles then exert more constraint on grain growth during cooling
and more restriction on plastic ﬂow during deformation, which can
also contribute to an increase in hardness and strength [41]. Higher
porosity always results in lower hardness because the porosity sites
act as zones for easy dislocation movement. It can be inferred from
the data in Table 5 that the squeeze casting process can greatly
reduce porosity due to the pressure applied during solidiﬁcation,
helping micropores coalesce in the casting.
3.4. Tensile and compressive strength
The tensile stress-strain curves of the four different types of
aluminum metal matrix composites are shown in Fig. 7. Tensile
properties such as yield strength (sy), ultimate tensile strength
(UTS), elongation to fracture (εf), and fracture stress (sf) were
extracted from these stress-strain curves [Table 6]. The sy of
AlSi7Mg þ alumina was 53 MPa. The ultimate tensile strength of
AlSi7Mg þ alumina was 172 MPa with a εf of 4.6% and a sF of
171 MPa AlSi7Mg þ alumina displayed the predominance of tensile
properties as compared to other combinations of samples. In the
case of scrap aluminium alloy þ alumina, the values for sy, ultimate
tensile strength, εf, and sf were 37.3 MPa, 125 MPa, 2.7% and
125 MPa, respectively. The sample made with spent alumina catalyst as reinforcement showed very low tensile strength because of
higher porosity (Figs. 1 and 3) as well as the calculated percentage
of porosity. The ultimate tensile strength of the AlSi7Mg þ spent
alumina catalyst and scrap aluminium alloy þ spent alumina
catalyst composites were measured as 93 MPa and 82 MPa,
respectively. AlSi7Mg þ alumina was found to be relatively more
ductile than the other specimens, followed by scrap aluminium
alloy þ alumina. This ﬁnding could be due to the lower porosity and
more uniform distribution of the alumina reinforcement in the
matrix.

1055

From the information in Table 6, it can be inferred that the
reinforcement particle size greatly inﬂuenced the ultimate tensile
strength. An increase of 85% and 52.4% in the ultimate tensile
strength was achieved when alumina was used as a reinforcement
in AlSi7Mg and the scrap aluminium alloy matrix, respectively,
instead of the spent alumina catalyst. The smaller size of the
alumina as well as the higher content (the spent alumina catalyst
had a lower alumina content) provided more sites for nucleation of
the silicon eutectic phase, and this mixture of particles in the grain
boundaries acted as an obstacle, restricting the motion of dislocations in the matrix [14]. In addition, the uniform distribution of the
particles in the mixture as conﬁrmed by the optical and scanning
electron microscopic images helped in transferring the applied
tensile load to the uniformly distributed strong mixture of alumina
and eutectic silicon phase particles [14]. When comparing the
composite produced using the AlSi7Mg and the scrap aluminium
alloy as a matrix with alumina as reinforcement, the AlSi7Mg
showed an increase of 37.6% in the ultimate tensile strength value
over the scrap aluminium alloy. Again, this ﬁnding is mainly
because of the higher silicon content in the AlSi7Mg which resulted
in a higher mixture of the alumina and the eutectic silicon phase as
well as the smaller grain size of the matrix (Table 4). Only a small
increase (13.4%) in the ultimate tensile strength was observed
when AlSi7Mg was used as a matrix and was compared to the scrap
aluminium alloy matrix (both matrices were reinforced with spent
alumina catalyst). As explained earlier in this work, the smaller
grain size of the AlSi7Mg resulted in the higher ultimate tensile
strength value. The higher porosity as well as the poor bonding
(discussed in the following fracture analysis of the composites)
between the reinforcement particle mixture and the matrix resulted in lower ultimate tensile strength values when spent alumina
catalyst was used as a reinforcement.
The compression test was carried out on the samples to determine compression properties and identify fracture patterns. Fig. 8
depicts the stress-strain curves acquired from compression tests.
Table 6 also shows the compression properties such as yield
strength (syc), ultimate compressive strength (UCS), and fracture
stress (sfc) extracted from these stress-strain curves. The
AlSi7Mg þ alumina composite exhibited the highest sfc (336 MPa)
at a deformation up to eight mm from the original length, with an
ultimate compressive strength of 346 MPa. For the scrap
aluminium alloy þ alumina composite, the sfc occurred at
248 MPa at a deformation up to eight mm, and the ultimate
compressive strength of the aluminum metal matrix composite was
312 MPa. These ﬁndings suggest that scrap aluminium
alloy þ alumina had a slightly lower load-bearing capacity than
other composites tested perhaps due to the higher hardening rate
in the AlSi7Mg alloy matrix. A similar phenomenon was seen in the
compressive response of the AlSi7Mg þ alumina composite as well
as the smaller grain size of the AlSi7Mg (Table 4). The sfc of the
AlSi7Mg þ spent alumina catalyst composite was 221 MPa at a

deformation of ﬁve mm from the original length. In contrast, scrap
aluminium alloy þ spent alumina catalyst's ultimate compressive
strength was found to be 265 MPa at a deformation of six mm from
the original length, indicating a sharp decrease in the load-bearing
capacity of the aluminum metal matrix composites reinforced with
spent alumina catalyst. The ultimate compressive strength of
AlSi7Mg þ spent alumina catalyst and scrap aluminium
alloy þ spent alumina catalyst were 234 MPa and 274 MPa,
respectively, which correlated with the porosity observed in micrographs as well as the porosity percentage. Thus, it can be
concluded that the effect of reinforcement type (especially the size)
on both tensile and compressive strengths was signiﬁcant. For the
same matrix alloy (AlSi7Mg), alumina reinforced composites
resulted in a 48% increase in the ultimate compressive strength as
compared to those reinforced with spent alumina catalysts. This
ﬁnding conﬁrms the signiﬁcant effect of the alumina mixed with
the silicon eutectic phase in strengthening the composites by acting
as a barrier for crack propagation. During the compression tests, all
samples bulged, or deformed, in a barrel shape, and they continued
to do so until fracturing (Fig. 8 inset). In all cases, the sample did not

detach itself along the diagonal planes after fracture. The presence
of a friction constraint between contacting ﬂat sample ends
generated a non-uniform plastic ﬂow in the compressed samples.
Such non-uniformity of the ﬂow and accompanying materials
weakened the composites and created shear deformation in the
diagonal plane. Small increases in ultimate compressive strength
for the scrap aluminium alloy matrix reinforced with alumina (14%
higher than the same matrix reinforced with spent alumina catalyst) were obtained. Similarly, an 11% increase in ultimate
compressive strength for the alumina reinforced in the AlSi7Mg
matrix was obtained as compared to the scrap aluminium alloy
reinforced with the same alumina. The higher alumina concentration (as compared to the spent alumina catalyst) as well as the
higher silicon content in the AlSi7Mg matrix (as compared to the
scrap aluminium alloy) helped create more nucleation sites for the
mixture of the alumina and eutectic silicon which accounted for the
higher value of ultimate compressive strength in the above two
composites.
The yield and ultimate strength estimated from the stress-strain
curves of the aluminum metal matrix composite samples for both

tensile and compressive tests are shown in Fig. 9. Based on the
tensile and compressive strength, the AlSi7Mg þ alumina composite showed superior properties followed by the scrap
aluminium alloy þ alumina composite. The higher strength of the
AlSi7Mg þ alumina composite can be attributed to the higher silicon weight percentage (7 wt %) in the matrix [38]. As explained in
the section on morphological analysis, the mixture of acicular
eutectic silicon and reinforcement at the grain boundaries
enhanced the mechanical properties. The intergranular distribution
at the grain boundaries provided better mechanical properties and

prevented failure along grain boundaries. The smaller grain size of
the AlSi7Mg matrix, especially with the alumina reinforcement,
also contributed to the enhanced mechanical properties. The
smaller size of the alumina reinforcement provided more nucleation sites for the eutectic silicon phase. The trends shown in Fig. 9
suggest an exception in the ultimate compressive strength value in
the case of the scrap aluminium alloy (17% higher than the AlSi7Mg
matrix) reinforced with the same spent alumina catalyst. This trend
can be explained by the higher levels of porosity in the composites
with scrap aluminium alloy as a matrix, which acted as zones for

absorbing the compressive force; thus, they showed a higher ultimate compressive strength. During tensile loading, the higher
porosity acted as a site for the crack propagation, so a slightly lower
ultimate tensile strength was obtained as compared to that of the
AlSi7Mg matrix.
All tensile samples were fractured within the gauge length.
Fig. 10 shows the scanning electron microscopic images of the
fracture surfaces of all four composites. It is obvious from the
fracture surface morphology that the samples have failed predominantly because of the brittle mode of fracture, although very
little ductility could be observed based on the presence of a few
dimples in the matrix region of the morphology. This ﬁnding was
also supported by the tensile performance depicted in Fig. 7. The
fracture surface was not completely perpendicular to the direction
of the applied stress, which is an indication that the material was
not purely brittle but had some ductility due to the aluminum
matrix material's property. The stress-strain curves illustrated in
Fig. 7 corroborate this behavior. The relatively more dimpled,
fractured appearance of the AlSi7Mg matrix conﬁrms that the
AlSi7Mg matrix was more ductile compared to the scrap aluminium
alloy, and this ﬁnding is again in line with the stress-strain curves.
In all the composites reinforced with alumina as well as spent
alumina catalyst, voids appeared due to debonding of the reinforcement particles from the matrix. The inset image in Fig. 10 (b)
shows a typical void created by debonding of the reinforcement.
The voids' dimensions matched the average reinforcement particle
size of 50 mm and 150 mm for alumina and spent alumina catalyst,
respectively. Poor wetting and interfacial bonding with the matrix
resulted in these types of voids [42]. In the case of composites
reinforced with spent alumina catalyst, some of the spent alumina
catalyst particles were still attached loosely in their position [inset
image in Fig. 10 (c)], and this ﬁnding was more obvious in the case

of the scrap aluminium alloy þ spent alumina catalyst metal matrix
composite. The larger size of the spent alumina catalyst particles
resulted in a weak interfacial bonding between the matrix and the
reinforcement so particle fracturing did not occur [17]. Fig. 10(c)
and (d) also show that the number of pores was higher, particularly
for the scrap aluminium alloy þ spent alumina catalyst composite
in which large-sized pores are visible. The AlSi7Mg þ alumina
composite also had a deep pore as illustrated in the inset image of
Fig. 10 (a). This ﬁnding was consistent with the porosity measurements illustrated in Fig. 5 (A), where the scrap aluminium
alloy þ spent alumina catalyst composite showed the highest
porosity percentage, and it was conﬁrmed by a large number of
pores in the microstructure images [Fig. 1(c) and (d)].
The tensile and compressive strengths of aluminum metal matrix composites with alumina as reinforcement which earlier researchers produced using the squeeze casting process are shown in
Fig. 11 [17,18,20,43e46]. The aluminum metal matrix composites
produced using scrap aluminium alloy as a matrix exhibited a
similar ultimate tensile strength value as other aluminum metal
matrix composites, while a slightly better compressive strength
was observed when compared to other aluminum metal matrix
composites reported in the literature. This ﬁnding suggests that the
scrap aluminium alloy matrix is a good candidate as a matrix material for aluminum metal matrix composite production.
3.5. Abrasion wear
Fig. 12 shows the weight loss of the aluminum metal matrix
composite samples when subjected to an abrasive wear test. The
scrap aluminium alloy þ alumina composite experienced the
lowest weight loss when compared to other composite samples
subjected to the abrasive sheets. SiC E4 600 TP4 had the ﬁnest grit

composite that exhibited the minimum wear rate for the ES20
abrasive sheet (coarsest grade) among the four composite samples
during abrasion. Fig. 13 (A) clearly shows diminished wear tracks
and grooves. The absence of localized delamination on the worn
surface as well as dislodged particles indicate that no reinforcement particles were detached. Grooves are the characteristic
feature of abrasive wear, but there was an absence of prominent
scratching tracks and groves parallel to the abrasion. Fig. 13 (B)
shows very few surface deformations, including sub-surface
cracks, even with the very coarse abrasive loaded wheel. Surface
deformation is a centre for crack nucleation, with propagation
leading to greater wear rates [47]. The repeated sliding action of the
abrasive wheel on the composites induces fatigue stresses, causing
sub-surface cracks [48]. The plastically displaced matrix material
can be observed in the magniﬁed image shown as an inset in Fig. 13
(B), but the matrix was not affected much.

and produced a weight loss of 0.01 g for the scrap aluminium
alloy þ alumina composite. The next ﬁnest grit sheet produced
weight loss of 0.015 g for the same composite. ES60 and ES20
produced weight losses of 0.038 g and 0.041 g, respectively. It was
noted that the increase of roughness on the mating parts increased
the wear rate of the samples, and the materials' hardness was
directly proportional to the materials' wear resistance. This ﬁnding
was conﬁrmed by Brinell hardness values for the four composites
(Table 4). The better wear resistance of the scrap aluminium
alloy þ alumina sample can be attributed to its greater hardness as
well as the uniform distribution of reinforcements, reﬁned grain
structure, and lower porosity as compared to other samples.

wear morphology of the scrap aluminium alloy þ alumina

A novel approach was successfully utilized for the ﬁrst time to
produce aluminum metal matrix composites for potential industrial applications. The produced aluminum metal matrix composite
is not only economical but also environmentally friendly because it
uses scrap or waste materials. The key ﬁndings are summarized as
follows:
 The micrograph analysis showed that the scrap aluminium
alloy þ alumina composite had a uniform distribution of reinforcements and the lowest porosity among the four composites. The composite porosity observed in the micrographs
correlated with the percentage of porosity measured using
Archimedes' principle.
 X-ray diffraction analyses conﬁrmed no signiﬁcant phase formation in the aluminum metal matrix composites regardless of
whether scrap aluminium alloy or spent alumina catalyst was
used.
 Among the four composites, the highest hardness (58.8 BHN)
was obtained for the AlSi7Mg þ alumina composite followed

very closely by the scrap aluminium alloy þ alumina composite
(58.5 BHN).
 The highest ultimate tensile and compressive strength values
were obtained for the AlSi7Mg þ alumina composite (172 MPa
and 346 MPa, respectively). The second highest values were
obtained by the scrap aluminium alloy þ alumina composite
(125 MPa and 312 MPa, respectively).
 The signiﬁcantly higher ultimate tensile and compressive
strength values in the composites reinforced with alumina can
be mainly attributed to the formation of the reinforcement
mixed with the eutectic silicon phase exhibiting a morphology
that was a slightly acicular, predominantly spherical structure
with some blunted, needle-like shapes.
 The addition of the spent alumina catalyst as reinforcement in
both of the matrix materials resulted in higher porosity due to
the air entrapment mechanism; therefore, the materials
exhibited lower mechanical properties.
 The fracture surface of the tensile test samples of all the composites failed predominantly through the brittle mode of fracture, although a limited ductile mode could also be observed.
 The abrasion wear test results showed that the scrap aluminium
alloy þ alumina composite possessed the highest wear resistance among the four prepared aluminum metal matrix composite samples. The wear morphology of the scrap aluminium
alloy þ alumina composite exhibited diminished wear tracks
and grooves even for the coarsest grade of abrasive sheet among
the four composite samples.
In the present investigations, optimal mechanical properties
were obtained for scrap aluminium alloy þ alumina, composite;
thus, it is recommended for potential industrial applications. Using
scrap aluminium alloy as a matrix material is a viable approach for
producing low-cost, high-performance aluminum metal matrix
composites. Scrap aluminium alloy can be utilized as an alternative
low-cost matrix material instead of virgin AlSi7Mg. Future studies
could focus on optimizing the process parameters of squeeze
casting and exploring nano particles as reinforcement that could
further enhance the mechanical properties for high-end
applications.

Microstructure Evolution and Mechanical Property Response via 3D
Printing Parameter Development of Al-Sc Alloy
Abstract
3D printed Sc-modified Al alloy by Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) performs significant
strength and ductility without hot tearing during process. This kind of 3D-printable high
specific strength material exhibits great potential in lightweight applications. Due to the less
design limitation through 3D printing process, the degree of lightweight is greatly affected by
the specific strength of the materials. Hence, to further improve the mechanical properties of
the material through process optimization or post treatment is of great importance.
Microstructure feature variations due to different processing parameters are well known for
traditional process and materials. This study explores the parameter microstructure
performance relationship of 3D printed Sc-modified Al alloys from the perspective of melting
pool interactions. According to stress concentration effect and Hall-Petch effect, the
mechanical properties of the 3D printed materials vary greatly depending on the differences
in defect size, shape, and grain size.
Keywords: powder bed fusion; selective laser melting; additive manufacturing; Al-Sc alloy;
mechanical property

1. Introduction
Generally, there are two ways to fabricate lightweight products, one is to introduce the
materials exhibit high specific strength and the other one is to introduce the design with
lightweight structure. However, it is very hard to achieve these two approaches at the same
time by traditional processes. With the development of the additive manufacturing technology,
materials that are difficult to be manufactured by traditional processes are re-emerging and
playing a pivotal role in lightweight issues (Chua, Leong, and Lim 2010; Gibson, Rosen, and
Stucker 2010; Liu et al. 2016; Zhao et al. 2016; N. Sudarmadji 2011; Murr 2017; S.Y. Chen
2018). Additive manufacturing technology, also known as rapid prototyping technology, is
mainly divided into Rapid Prototyping (RP) technology and Rapid Manufacturing (RM)
technology. The most well-known characteristics of additive manufacturing technology are
the customized production and small amount of diverse production (Chua, Leong, and Lim
2010; Gibson, Rosen, and Stucker 2010; Liu et al. 2016; Zhao et al. 2016; N. Sudarmadji
2011; Murr 2017; S.Y. Chen 2018). The most widely used method for fabricating metal
products is powder bed fusion (PBF) method. And there are two powder bed fusion method
which are laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) and electron beam powder bed fusion (EBPBF)
(Chua, Leong, and Lim 2010; Gibson, Rosen, and Stucker 2010; Liu et al. 2016; Zhao et al.

2016; N. Sudarmadji 2011; Murr 2017; S.Y. Chen 2018).
Thanks to the maturity of 3D printing technology, porous materials of metal porous
structure could be well controlled and realized. The metal porous structure is a very common
special structural material (Yang et al. 2015; Murr et al. 2012; Yan et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2016;
Weißmann et al. 2016), which simultaneously exhibits high strength, light weight
characteristics, and good thermal resistance (Nakajima 2007; Evans et al. 2001; Li et al. 2014;
Tan et al. 2017). The metal porous structure could be divided into stochastic porous structures
and periodic cellular lattice structures, in which the periodic cell lattice structure could
exhibit better material properties at the same volume fraction (Evans et al. 2001; Cansizoglu
et al. 2008). Moreover, the porous materials fabricated by 3D printing technology are widely
used in high-end engineering products such as vehicles parts, aerospace parts and medical
implants (Zhou, Shrotriya, and Soboyejo 2004; W.Y. Yeong 2004; X. Wang 2016; S.A.
Khairallah 2016; D. Herzog 2016)
At the mean time, advanced lightweight materials 3D printing process/parameter R&D is
also received attention by global researchers. One of the advanced lightweight materials that
global researchers are focusing on is Al-Sc alloy, or so called Scalmalloy. In the Al alloy
system with the alloying elements (Cu, Mg, Zn, Si), hot tearing usually happened during
solidification due to the large solidification ranges that promoted by these elements. By
adding small amount of Sc, the Al3Sc phase nucleated at high temperature and provide lots of
nucleation sites and thus limited the formation of columnar grain and hot tearing during
cooling as well (Schmidtke et al. 2011; Jägle et al. 2016). Due to the fine grain size and
precipitation strengthening effect, Al-Sc alloy exhibit high strength and high ductility
(Schmidtke et al. 2011).
Since the high strength of Al-Sc alloy is contributed by the fine grain size and precipitation
strengthening effect, the strength could be further improved if the initial grain size can be
finer via the 3D printing parameter optimization by exploring the relationship between
parameter-microstructure-performance. To explore the relationship between the parameter,
defect, microstructure, and mechanical properties of the 3D printed materials, three selected
parameter were selected to fabricate advanced lightweight Al-Sc alloy by laser powder bed
fusion (LPBF) technology. The defect/microstructure evolution and relative mechanical
response via the change of 3D printing parameter of such materials was examined and
discussed carefully.

2. Experimental Procedure
2

2.1 Materials
Pre-alloyed Al-Sc (Scalmalloy) powder was provided by Heraeus Group and Circle Metal
Powder Co., Ltd. The powder size ranges mainly from 20 to 63 m, and the powder shape is
spherical. The chemical composition is shown as Table 1.
2.2 Laser Powder Bed Fusion
All of the samples of this study were manufactured by laser powder bed fusion method
using a Renishaw AM400 system. Before the process, the vacuum is drawn to about 1×10-2
torr, and the Ar protective atmosphere is backfilled to about one atmosphere. The maximum
power of the laser can reach about 400 W, and the scanning rate can reach up to about 2 m/s,
spot size is about 70 m, the thickness of each layer of metal powder is about 30 m, and the
maximum manufacturing size is about 25*25*30 cm3. Taking Al-Sc alloys as an example, the
building rate is about 5-20 cm3/hour. In this study, no post heat treatment has been conducted
on the as-built Al-Sc sample.
2.3 Microstructure Analysis
To observe the micro-sized defects and the microstructure carefully, the scanning electron
microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-6330) and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD, Zeiss
Supra 55) were introduced. Before the SEM observation, all of the samples were grinded and
polished carefully. For the EBSD examination, the samples were electro-polished after
mechanical grinding and polishing.
2.4 Tensile Test
The 3D printed Al-Sc alloy samples by LPBF were prepared for the tensile testing, which
was performed by an Instron 5582 universal testing machine at room temperature under a
strain rate of 1x10-4 s-1. Before tensile test, all of the samples were grinded and polished
carefully. The tensile testing of 3D printed Al-Sc alloy samples have been carried out for at
least 3 times, and all the mechanical properties are measured with tensile stress-strain curve.

3. Results and Discussion
3.1 Parameter Development
In this study, the main objective of parameter development is to decrease the size and
3

volume fraction of micron-sized defect and decrease the average grain size of 3D printed AlSc alloy. To determine the microstructure feature and related mechanical properties, cubic
samples with 1*1*1 cm3 for parameter study (Fig. 1) and tensile test samples refer to ASTM
E8 standard were fabricated. The tensile test samples were wire cut and grinded carefully to
remove the uneven surface due to powder attachment during 3D printing process(Fig. 2).
To explore the relationship between parameter-microstructure-performance, three
parameters were choose for further research after the 3D printing parameter R&D, which are:
1.

Al-Sc-O: the optimized parameter which exhibit highest densification and finer
average grain size.

2.

Al-Sc-L: the parameter with less overlap between nearby melting pool due to same
scan speed and 200% hatch distance compared to optimized parameter.
Al-Sc-S: the parameter with smaller melting pool size due to 200% scan speed and
same hatch distance compared to optimized parameter.

3.

The three choose parameters in detail were shown in Table 2.
3.2 Observation of Micron-Sized Defects
To investigate the inference of parameter on micron sized defects, all of the samples built
by the three parameters (3 samples for each parameter) were examined by SEM, the SEM
images were shown in Fig.3 and Fig. 4. According to the observation of Fig. 3(a) and Fig.
4(a), there were only few micron sized defects in the Al-Sc-O sample. And the largest
observed defect size was about 31.4 m. Meanwhile, the shape of the micron sized pore was
approximately spherical. In comparison, numinous micron sized defects were found in the
samples of Al-Sc-L and Al-Sc-S, as shown in Fig. 3(b-c) and Fig. 4(b-c). The largest
observed defect size in Al-Sc-L and Al-Sc-S were about 71.9 m and 305.1 m, respectively.
Moreover, there were approximately spherical and irregular shape micron sized pore in AlSc-L sample and there were only irregular shape micron sized pore in Al-Sc-S sample. All of
the micron sized defect feature are summarized in Table 3.
The density of all samples were measure by Archimedes method to explore the relationship
between the parameter and densification of the 3D printed alloy. The densification of the 3D
printed samples was calculated according to the following formula:
 = (s) ×  ,

(1)

4

where  and s are the density of the 3D printed sample and the theoretical density. The
theoretical density of Al-Sc alloy is 2.67 g/cm3. The measured density and calculated
densification of the samples built by the three parameter are summarized in Table 3.
According to the observation of micron-sized defects and the density measurement results,
the pore size, pore shape, density and calculated densification of each samples are quite
different. The difference in pore size and density came from the different interaction between
the nearby melting pool, as shown in Fig. 5. In the sample built by optimized parameter (AlSc-O), there existed perfect combination between the melting pool size and distance, as
shown in Fig. 5(a). And thus almost no defects were observed in the Al-Sc-O samples. In
comparison with the optimized parameter, the Al-Sc-L parameter exhibits same energy input
(same scan speed and power), and thus the melting pool size should be almost the same with
the optimized sample. However, since the hatch distance is larger than the optimized one and
thus the overlapping between the nearby melting pool is less than that in optimized sample
and thus there existed pore/unmelted region between melting pools nearby, as shown in Fig.
5(b). On the other hand, Al-Sc-S parameter exhibits less energy input (same power but lower
scan speed). Hence, the energy density and melting pool size are smaller than that in
optimized sample. Therefore, even the hatch distance in Al-Sc-S parameter is the same as that
in Al-Sc-O parameter, there existed more and larger pores/unmelted regions between melting
pools nearby, as shown in Fig. 5(c).
Due to the difference in the melting pool size and interaction between the melting pool
nearby, the pore size and densification of these three samples are quite different and it may
affect the mechanical properties following the concept of Gibson and Ashby model and stress
concentration. In general, the densification would affect the Young's modulus and yield stress
following Gibson and Ashby model(Gibson and Ashby 1982) which shown below:

E/Es = C1 (ρ⁄ρs )2

(2)

σpl ⁄σs = C2 (ρ⁄ρs )1.5 ,

(3)

where E is the elastic modulus of the porous structure, Es is the elastic modulus of the opencell edge (ligament) material, pl is the plateau stress of the porous material, s is the yield
strength of the ligament material,  is the density of the fabricated materials, s is the
theoretical density, and C1 and C2 are the constant varied with different materials and porous
structure.

5

On the other hand, the pore size and shape would affect the elongation following the stress
concentration effect. The stress concentration factor (Kt) is used to quantify how concentrated
the stress is in a material, and it is calculated by the formula below(W.D. Pilkey 2008):
𝑑

Kt = 1 + 2√𝜌

(4)

where d is the depth of the notch and  is the radius of the notch. And the elongation of tested
materials usually decreases with the increasing of Kt. The effect of Gibson and Ashby model
and stress concentration on mechanical properties will be discuss in section 3.4.
3.3 Observation of Microstructure Feature
The EBSD images of the samples built by the three parameters were shown in Fig. 6. The
trace of melting pools can be obviously observed in the EBSD results. According to the
EBSD results, there were micron-sized and submicron-sized grains due to the temperature
gradient and cooling rate difference from the surface to inside of the melting pools. The
submicron-sized grains showed up in darker regions and the micron-sized grains showed up
in the regions with colors. To clearly observe the grain size change due to the parameter
change, the enlarged EBSD images had been taken, as shown in Fig. 7. The grain size and
volume fraction of the micron-sized grains and submicron-sized grains were measured by line
intercept method (over 30 lines of each samples), and the results were summarized in Table 4.
In the Al-Sc-O samples, the grain size and volume fraction of micron-sized grains was about
2.16 m and 51.04 % while the grain size and volume fraction of submicron-sized grains was
0.40 m and 48.96 %. In the Al-Sc-L samples, the grain size and volume fraction of micronsized grains was about 2.40 m and 65.00 % while the grain size and volume fraction of
submicron-sized grains was 0.40 m and 35.00 %. In the Al-Sc-S samples, the grain size and
volume fraction of micron-sized grains was about 3.72 m and 78.89 % while the grain size
and volume fraction of submicron-sized grains was 0.44 m and 21.11 %. The average grain
size of the three samples was calculated by the grain size and volume fraction of micronsized grains and submicron-sized grains, which were 1.30 m (Al-Sc-O sample), 1.70 m
(Al-Sc-L sample), and 3.03 m (Al-Sc-S sample), respectively.
In the EBSD and grain size measurement results, the grain size of micron-sized grains of
Al-Sc-O sample was much smaller than the other two samples. Meanwhile, the volume
fraction of submicron-sized grains of Al-Sc-O sample was much higher than the other two
samples. The smaller grain size of micron-sized grains and higher volume fraction of
submicron-sized grains were cause by the higher cooling rate during the process according to
6

the remelting zone size and spacing affected by 3D printing parameter. The Schematic
illustration of the relationship between the parameters, remelting zone size and spacing of the
three samples is shown in Fig. 8. In Fig. 8(a), there existed larger remelting zone size and
thus wider the area around the surface of melting pool where contacted the lateral and vertical
printed solid parts with higher thermal conductivity and reduced the contacted area with the
powders with lower thermal conductivity.
In Fig. 8(b), there exists smaller lateral remelting zone due to the 200% hatch distance in
Al-Sc-L sample, and thus the contact area with the higher thermal conductivity solid parts is
reduced compared to the Al-Sc-O sample. Hence, cooling rate in Al-Sc-L sample was lower
than the Al-Sc-O sample and thus the grain size of the micron-size grains was larger in Al-ScL sample. Moreover, the spacing of the remelting zone is much higher in Al-Sc-L sample than
in Al-Sc-O sample, since the submicron-sized grains showed up on the cooled surface of
melting pool, higher spacing of the remelting zone or larger hatch distance means that the
repeat-occurrence number within a fixed distance of the submicron-sized region in Al-Sc-L
sample is less than that in Al-Sc-O sample. Therefore, the volume fraction of the submicronsized grains in Al-Sc-L sample is less than that in Al-Sc-O sample.
In Fig. 8(c), there exists smallest lateral and vertical remelting zone due to the smaller
melting pool in Al-Sc-S sample. Hence, the contact area with the higher thermal conductivity
solid parts in Al-Sc-S sample is smallest compared the other two samples. Therefore, the
cooling rate of Al-Sc-S sample was lowest and thus the grain size of the micron-size grains
was largest. Meanwhile, the repeat-occurrence number within a fixed distance of the
submicron-sized region in Al-Sc-S sample is less than that in Al-Sc-O sample as well. And it
means that the fraction of the submicron-sized grains in Al-Sc-S sample is less than that in
Al-Sc-O sample. Due to the Al-Sc-S sample exhibits smallest contact area with solid parts
and less repeat-occurrence number of the submicron-sized region, the average grain size was
higher than the other two samples.
3.4 Mechanical Properties
To explore the relationship between parameter-microstructure-performance, all of the
samples were tested by universal testing machine under tensile mode under a slow strain rate
of 1x10-4 s-1. The strain-stress curves of the samples with three different parameter are shown
in Fig. 9. All the 3D printed Al-Sc samples were tested for at least 3 times until mechanical
fracture occurred. The mechanical properties with yield stress (0.2% offset), Young’s
modulus and elongtion are listed in Table 5.

7

From Fig. 9 and Table 5, it can be seen that all of the samples exhibit similar Young’s
modulus but different in yield stress and elongation. The Young’s modulus only scatters
marginally from 72.07 to 72.11 GPa. According to Gibson and Ashby model, Young’s
modulus can be affected by the variation of densification. In Table 3, the densification of
these high dense samples only scatters marginally from 98.16% to 99.85%, it means the
difference in densification is only 1.69% and thus the Young’s modulus variation followed
Gibson and Ashby model is very limited.
The yield stress increases from 269.04, 282.56, to 286.94 MPa (an increment of 5.0% and
6.7%) with 3D printing parameter variation from Al-Sc-S, Al-Sc-L, to Al-Sc-O, respectively.
Following the Gibson and Ashby model, yield stress can be affected by the variation of
densification as well. However, the yield stress affected by densification should be very
limited since the densification difference is only 1.69%. On the other hand, the yield stress
can also be affected by grain size followed the empirical relationship of Hall-Petch effect
which shown below (Kim et al. 2013; Sanaty-Zadeh 2012):

𝜎𝐺𝑅 = 𝜎0 +

𝑘𝑦

(5)

√𝑑

where σGR is the strength of materials, σ0 is the yield strength of a single crystal in absence of
any strengthening mechanisms except the solid solution effect, d the average grain size and ky
is a constant depending on the materials. Meanwhile, in Table 4, the grain size decreases
from 3.03 m, 1.70 m, to 1.30 m with 3D printing parameter variation from Al-Sc-S, AlSc-L, to Al-Sc-O. The grain size change is obvious and thus it should be the key factor that
affects the variation of yield stress of the 3D printed Al-Sc alloys in this study.
The elongation of these samples built by different parameter increases from 11.59%,
14.44%, to 18.39% (an increment of 24.6% and 58.7%) with 3D printing parameter variation
from Al-Sc-S, Al-Sc-L, to Al-Sc-O, respectively. The obviously variation in elongation
should be contributed by the pore size and shape followed the stress concentration factor. In
Table 3, the max pore size decreases from 305.1, 71.9, to 31.4 m (size differences are about
424.3% and 971.7%) with 3D printing parameter variation from Al-Sc-S, Al-Sc-L, to Al-Sc-O,
respectively. The serious difference in pore size would serious affect the deformation stability
during the plastic deformation. Meanwhile, the pore shape changes from irregular, spherical
and irregular, to near spherical with 3D printing parameter variation from Al-Sc-S, Al-Sc-L,
to Al-Sc-O, respectively. According to the concept of stress concentration effect, the radius of
the notch would greatly affect the stress concentrated at the tip of notch. And thus the stress
concentration factor of Al-Sc-S sample is much larger than that of Al-Sc-O sample on the
8

basis of great difference in pore size (971.7% in difference) and shape (irregular to near
spherical).

4. Conclusion
The Al-Sc alloy were successfully fabricated by 3D printing via the laser powder bed
fusion (LPBF) technology. Meanwhile, the relationship between parameter-microstructureperformance was explored. The following conclusions can be drawn.
1. The defect and microstructure evolution related to the interaction of melting pool can be
predicted and controlled by change the process parameter.
2. The pore size (31.4 to 305.1 m), shape (near spherical to irregular), and densification
(98.16 to 99.85%) can be varied by changing the melting pool size and overlapping
between melting pools nearby. According to stress concentration effect, such difference
would affect the ductility of printed materials serious (18.39 to 11.59%).
3. The grain size difference of as built samples can be large as 233.1% (1.30 to 3.03 m) via
change the remelting zone size and spacing. According to Hall-Petch effect, the yield
stress of printed materials would be affected (286.96 to 269.04 MPa).

High strengthductility synergy is difﬁcult to achieve in Mg alloys. Although high strength has been achieved
through considerable alloying addition and low-temperature extrusion, these techniques result in low ductility (2%5%). In this work, a novel low-alloy MgCa-based alloy that overcomes this strengthductility tradeoff is designed. The alloy has an excellent tensile yield strength (»425 MPa) and exhibits a reasonably high
elongation capacity (»11%). A microstructure examination reveals that a high density of submicron grains
and nano-precipitates provides the alloy high strength, and the leaner alloy additions and higher extrusion
temperatures initially improve ductility. As a result, the density of residual dislocations is reduced, and the
formation of low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) is enhanced. With fewer residue dislocations, it becomes
less probable for the newly activated mobile dislocations to be impeded and transformed into an immobile
type during the subsequent tensile test. The LAGBs function as potential sites to emit new dislocations, thus
enhancing the dislocationmultiplication capability. More importantly, they can induce evident sub-grain
reﬁnement hardening and guarantee that the alloy achieves high strength. The ﬁndings lead to a controllable
Mg alloy design strategy that can simultaneously afford high strength and ductility.

1. Introduction
Magnesium alloy is the lightest structural metallic material.
Accordingly, it has a considerable potential to be widely used in electronics and transportation industries to save on weight [14].
Although the signiﬁcance of Mg alloys as a class of engineering materials has been acknowledged, the adoption of Mg wrought alloy in
industry remains limited predominantly because of its high-cost, low
strengthductility synergy, and low corrosion resistance. In the
recent decade, considerable efforts have been expended to develop
high-performance Mg alloys [57]. With regard to high-strength
alloys, the MgGdY-based extrusion alloy with a considerable rareearth (RE) addition (> 16 wt.%) has the highest recorded yield
strength (»500 MPa) among alloys with Mg [5]. The high RE addition,
however, signiﬁcantly increases cost, thus considerably limiting the

application of heavily alloyed MgRE alloys. To reduce the cost
resulting from RE addition, high-strength RE-free Mg extrusion alloys
have been developed [6,8,9]. Among RE-free Mg alloys, the highest
recorded yield strength (»443 MPa) is that of the Mg2Sn2Ca alloy
[6]. Other high-strength RE-free Mg alloys are based on the
MgAlCa(Zn) system, whose yield strength is reportedly
410420 MPa [8,9]. These high-strength alloys, however, have a high
alloying concentration (4 wt.% at a minimum) [1012], which
increases their processing cost and compresses the processing window [1317]. Moreover, excessive alloying addition normally leads
to the formation of considerable amounts of eutectic compounds during casting that cannot be fully dissolved through homogenisation
treatment. These particles are detrimental to alloy ductility; this
explains why the Mg alloys that are reported to be highly ductile are
predominantly based on dilute alloy systems that essentially contain
no coarse second-phase eutectic-particles. The problem, however, is
that these dilute alloys generally have low strengths (approximately
150200 MPa) [1820].
An effective approach to improve the strength of dilute alloys is
through grain reﬁnement because this technique affords a distinctly
high slope coefﬁcient, ky, in the typical HallPetch relationship [21].

H. Pan et al. / Acta Materialia 186 (2020) 278290

Grain reﬁnement techniques, such as equal channel angular pressing
and high-pressure torsion (HPT), have been employed to fabricate
ultra-ﬁne grains (UFGs) in Mg alloys [22,23]. These severe deformation
routes, however, are usually extremely expensive and not suitable for
a scale-up. An alternative method to produce Mg alloys with UFGs is
low-temperature extrusion [6,24]. Recently, an average grain size of
»0.65 mm was reported in a commercial Mg3Al1Zn0.3Mn (AZ31)
alloy extruded at a low temperature of 175 °C [24]. It is improbable,
however, that such a low extrusion temperature is to be widely
adopted by industry, because it will induce considerable tool wear and
retard production efﬁciency. Moreover, once the extrusion temperature is reduced, the residue dislocation density will substantially
increase, producing high residue stress and low ductility [25]. For
example, when the MgCaSn alloy is extruded at 220 °C, the resulting ductility of only »1.2% is insufﬁcient [6]. A higher extrusion temperature therefore is necessary to guarantee reasonable ductility. The
major problem then is the preservation of high strength in dilute alloys
extruded at an increased temperature.
One approach to maintain high-strength after high-temperature
processing is to add solute atoms that can strongly segregate to grain
boundaries and effectively suppress grain boundary migration at high
temperatures. For example, with the addition of Ca, the grain size of
MgCa binary alloy can be reduced to only 0.71 mm [26,27]. Another
method is to induce high-density nano-precipitates, which are reportedly
capable of strengthening Mg alloys [28]. Precipitation strengthening has
been reported in highly formable and dilute Mg1.3Al
0.8Zn0.7Mn0.5Ca alloys during post-forming baking [20]. In this case,
however, the nano-precipitate-induced strengthening is only limited to
»40 MPa. Nevertheless, the optimisation of alloy composition to achieve
maximum precipitation strengthening remains advantageous.
Based on the aforementioned alloy design strategy, the objective is
to develop a new Mg wrought alloy with high strengthductility synergy based on the Mg1CaxAl system. The concentration of Ca is limited at 1 wt.% because the maximum solubility of Ca in Mg at the
eutectic temperature of 510 °C is approximately 1 wt.%. Aluminiumcalcium nano-precipitates, which have been reported in formable Mg wrought alloys, are formed through Al addition [18,29]. The
Pandat database is thereafter employed to determine the suitable Al
concentration and thermomechanical processing temperature. As
shown in the calculated phase diagram (Fig. 1), 1 wt.% of Al (red dashed
line) is selected. If the Al concentration is extremely low, then low-density Al2Ca particles, which may not sufﬁciently strengthen the alloy, are
expected to form. On the other hand, if the Al concentration is overly
high, e.g., more than 1.4 wt.%, then coarse intermetallic particles will
more probably form and decrease ductility. With 1 wt.% of Al in
Mg1Ca, dense Al2Ca particles may possibly precipitate from the

279

supersaturated solid solution after the alloy is solution-treated above
420 °C and aged/processed at a lower temperature. The designed thermomechanical processing therefore includes a homogenisation treatment at 500 °C (black dashed line) and an extrusion at 300 °C (green
dashed line), allowing the dynamic precipitation of sufﬁcient Al2Ca particles during hot extrusion. The addition of diluted Zn and Ca is necessary because it can weaken the basal texture and improve alloy
ductility [30]; consequently, high strengthductility synergy is
achieved. The main purpose of this work is to explore the strengthening and plasticisation mechanism of the aforementioned Mg alloy
based on microstructural characterisation. Accordingly, it is anticipated
to aid in providing new insights into further improving the alloy
strength and ductility simultaneously.
2. Experimental
The Mg1.0Ca1.0Al0.2Zn0.1Mn alloy (in wt.%) is fabricated
by melting commercial pure Mg (99.97 wt.%), Ca (99.90 wt.%), Al
(99.99 wt.%), Zn (99.90 wt.%), and Mg6 wt.% Mn master alloys in the
induction melting furnace. The reason for Mn addition is to purify the
ingot by forming MnFe compounds. The as-cast billets are homogenised at 500 °C for 24 h and thereafter indirectly extruded at temperatures of 250, 300, and 330 °C with an extrusion ratio of 20:1 and a
die-exit speed of »1.0 m/min. Dog-bone specimens with a gauge
length of 30 mm and a diameter of 5 mm are employed for tensile
tests. The initial tensile strain rate is set to 1 £ 103 s1 (Shimazu AGX Plus); three parallel samples are tested. The microstructures are
characterised by optical microscopy (OM, Olympus GX), scanning
electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JEM-7001F), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD, Zeiss FEGSEM).
The orientation imaging microscopy software of HKL-Channel 5 is
utilised for data analysis. The misorientation angles between adjacent grains are used to identify the low-angle grain boundary
(LAGB: 2°  u  15°; white lines) and high-angle grain boundary
(HAGB: u  15°; black lines).
The diffraction proﬁles are measured using a Bruker D8 advanced
X-ray diffractometer with the Cu-Ka radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. Zero error and instrument proﬁles are
assessed based on the scan of the NIST LaB6 specimen. The sample
micro-strain is calculated from the half-width of diffraction peaks
using TOPAS 5 Rietveld-based reﬁnement software [31] with Balzar’s
double-Voigt approach [32]; details of the ﬁtting process can be
found in the TOPAS manual [33].
Thin foils for transmission electron microscopy observations are
prepared by mechanical polishing (»40 mm) followed by ion beam
thinning (GATAN, PIPS691). Transmission electron microscopy with
an accelerating voltage of 200 kV (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F) is employed
to characterise the grain structures and dislocation lines; weak-beam
dark-ﬁeld images are used to determine the dislocation characters.
Under the two-beam condition of g = 0001, the visible dislocation
segments belong to the hc + ai type in Mg alloys according to the
g¢b = 0 invisible criterion [34]. Scanning TEM (STEM) and high-angle
annular dark-ﬁeld (HAADF) observations are also conducted. Specimens for atom probe tomography (APT) are prepared by mechanical
tripod polishing followed by Ar-ion milling in a PIPSTM -II (Gatan). The
APT is performed in a CAMECA LEAP 4000 HR type local electrode
atom probe at a temperature of 50 K with a pulse fraction of 15% and
a pulse rate of 200 kHz. The reconstruction and quantitative analysis
of APT data are performed using IVASTM 3.6.12 software.

extruded at 250 °C (sample designated as XAZM-250) is high at
»410 MPa; however, its elongation to failure (EL) is only »1.0%.
When the extrusion temperature is increased to »300 °C (sample
designated as XAZM-300), the tensile YS increases to »425 MPa. Generally, a high extrusion temperature results in a lower strength. For
example, when the extrusion temperature is increased from 250 to
300 °C, the yield strength of Mg3Al1Zn1Ca0.3Mn alloy
decreases from 420 to 330 MPa [9]. In the present study, high
strength is preserved in XAZM-300, but more importantly, the EL of
this alloy is considerably enhanced to »11%, which is more than
10 times that of XAZM-250. By further increasing the forming temperature, i.e., »330 °C (XAZM-330), the tensile YS reduces to
383 MPa and the EL increases to »12.5%.
Fig. 2(b) shows that the strengthductility combinations of the
low-alloy XAZM samples extruded at 300 and 330 °C are superior to
those of previously reported RE-free Mg alloys (such as MgSnAl
(Zn) [3537], MgAlZn(Zr) [3843], and MgAl(Zn)Ca(Mn)
[8,9,44,45]) as well as our recently reported MgSnCa alloys and
binary MgCa dilute alloys [6,46]. Moreover, the mechanical properties of XAZM-300 alloy are even comparable to those of RE-containing Mg alloys (such as MgGdYZr [5], MgGdYZnZr
[1012], and MgZnGd(Y)(Zr) [16]). Furthermore, the YS value
divided by the weight percentage of solute atoms (referred to ‘YS
increment per weight’) of the Ca-containing alloy reaches »170 MPa/
wt.%, which is considerably larger than those of most Mg wrought
alloys previously reported (usually less than »100 MPa/wt.%)
[517,3549]. The high strengthductility synergy and high costeffectiveness (e.g., low alloying and non-RE element addition) make
this alloy competitive for future industrial applications.
3.2. Microstructures of as-extruded XAZM alloys
3.2.1. LAGBs and dislocations
The optical microscopy images shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b) show the
microstructure of extruded XAZM-250 and XAZM-300 samples at
low-magniﬁcation, respectively. Dynamic recrystallised (DRXed)
grains (the dark contrast is caused by the dense etched grain boundaries) and elongated un-DRXed grains (bright contrast) are observed
in both samples. In XAZM-300 (Fig. 3(a)), the un-DRXed grains have a
small size (»10 mm wide and 30 mm long) and homogeneous distribution. The area fraction is determined to be »28% using Image-Pro
software based on contrast differences. On the other hand, the unDRXed grains in XAZM-250 have a considerably larger size and an
inhomogeneous distribution (»200 mm or larger in length; Fig. 3(b)).
The area fraction of un-DRXed grains is estimated to be »67%.

At higher magniﬁcations, the corresponding EBSD results exhibit
detailed microstructural features. It is observed that the diameter of
DRXed grains in the ductile XAZM-300 alloy is in the range
200500 nm (Fig. 3(c) and (d)). The inverse pole ﬁgure map shows
that the un-DRXed regions are subdivided by LAGBs into sub-grain
lamellae and have a strong ﬁbre texture with < 1010 > //ED (extrusion direction; Fig. 3(c)). In contrast, the DRXed grains exhibit a more
randomised texture with the major component < 1120 > //ED. The
texture intensity and volume fraction of XAZM-300 DRXed grains are
estimated to be »18.25 multiples of random distribution and »47%,
respectively (Fig. 3(c)(e)). The grain size distribution histogram of
XAZM-300 is shown in the inset of the band contrast image in Fig. 3
(d), and the average grain size is estimated to be »0.37 mm considering both DRXed grains and sub-grains. The kernel average misorientation (KAM) map (Fig. 3(e)) indicates a larger orientation gradient
within as-deformed regions than that in DRXed grains. It is more
probably caused by the high density of residual dislocations to
accommodate the local lattice strains in un-DRXed grains. This type
of dislocations is typically named as ‘geometrically necessary dislocations’ (GNDs) [5052]. The average misorientation in XAZM-300 is
estimated to be »0.53°.
For the brittle XAZM-250 alloy, the bimodal grain microstructure
is also observed (Fig. 3(f)(h)). In the as-deformed grains, however,
the density of LAGBs is considerably lower than that within the
XAZM-300 alloy. As a result, the inter-spacing of these LAGBs is
apparently large (520 mm). Moreover, some narrow sub-grains
occupying a certain area fraction still exist in the as-extruded XAZM250 alloy. Accordingly, the average size of grains and sub-grains in
the XAZM-250 alloy is estimated to be »0.31 mm (Fig. 3(g)), which is
lower than that in the XAZM-300 alloy. The average misorientation
angle in the KAM map also increases to »0.85 ° because of the low
volume fraction of DRXed regions (»19%; Fig. 3(h)). The density of
residue dislocations in XAZM-250 is thus identiﬁed to be higher than
that in XAZM-300.
The higher density of residue dislocations in the XAZM-250 alloy is
conﬁrmed by the XRD spectrum (Fig. 4). By ﬁtting the ð1010Þ diffraction peak, the micro-strain is calculated to be 0.00105 § 0.00002 in
XAZM-250. In contrast, the micro-strain in XAZM-300 is found to be
lower (0.00088 § 0.00001). The micro-strain along the hci axis is measured by ﬁtting the (0002) diffraction peak. Again, XAZM-250 exhibits
a larger micro-strain than XAZM-300 along the hci axis—approximately 0.00125 § 0.00012 and 0.00105 § 0.00008, respectively.
High-magniﬁcation images of as-extruded XAZM microstructures
are shown in Fig. 5. Signiﬁcant lattice strain is generated in XAZM-250

grains (purple arrows, Fig. 5(a)). Moreover, a limited number of LAGBs
are observed within the Mg matrix (red arrows, Fig. 5(a)(c)), which
are consistent with the EBSD results in Fig. 3. The bright/dark-ﬁeld TEM
images (Fig. 5(b) and (c)) show numerous long and straight dislocations
lying on the basal plane that belong to the non-basal hc + ai type based
on the g¢b = 0 invisible criterion [53,54]; these are denoted as ‘B-type’
dislocations. It can be observed that certain dislocations are trapped by
nano-particles, and the density of residual dislocations is extremely
high. As the extrusion temperature increases to 300 °C, the density of
dislocations in XAZM-300 is considerably reduced; correspondingly,
higher-density LAGBs are formed within the Mg matrix (Fig. 5(d)(f)).
The un-DRXed regions with strong ﬁbre textures are saturated with
numerous well-established LAGBs, and the thickness of sub-grain
lamellae is reduced to as low as »200 nm (Fig. 5(d)). For the XAZM-330
sample, a higher degree of dynamic recrystallisation is observed
(Fig. 5(g)) compared to that for the other samples extruded at lower

temperatures. The inter-distance of LAGBs in XAZM-330 is estimated to
be in the range 300900 nm (Fig. 5(h) and (i)), which is apparently
larger than that in XAZM-300.
The XAZM-250 alloy is examined at a higher magniﬁcation in TEM
to obtain a clearer view of microstructural features, as shown in
Fig. 6. Apart from the ‘B-type’ dislocations on the basal plane, a few
dislocations with hc + ai Burgers vectors, denoted as ‘P-type’ dislocations (indicated by yellow arrows in Fig. 6), lying on the pyramidal
plane are also observed in the as-extruded XAZM-250 alloy. Under
the two-beam condition of g = 0001 (to view the hc + ai dislocations),
the Mg matrix basal plane would be perpendicular with this g = 0001
direction. The basal plane can thus be indicated by a white line, as
shown in Fig. 6. In this context, any dislocation segments inclined
away from the basal plane should remain on the pyramidal planes.
The ‘P-type’ dislocations are thus identiﬁed to be full hc + ai dislocations [55]. It has been previously reported that full hc + ai dislocations

in Mg alloys are intrinsically unstable and facilely transform into the
sessile type, which is considered as the primary origin of poor ductility [56,57]. A recent work, however, demonstrated that hc + ai dislocations can exist and continuously glide on the pyramidal planes of
pure Mg single crystals (at least in the submicron-sized sample) [34].
In the present study, some full hc + ai dislocation segments are found
in the polycrystalline MgCa-based bulk alloy. These hc + ai dislocations are therefore highly probable to be mobile hc + ai dislocations
without the glissile-to-sessile transformation.
Furthermore, the bright/dark-ﬁeld TEM images in Fig. 6 show
nano-phases (green arrows and circles) and some debris exactly adjacent to these nano-phases, i.e., located in typical positions at A and B
(green rectangular box). The observed debris is induced as a consequence of the moving dislocations pinned by nano-particles; details
of the mechanism are reported in Ref. [34]. The moving ‘P-type’ dislocations (yellow arrow, Fig. 6(b)) are observed just behind the debris,
which further supports this mechanism. It should be noted that ‘Ptype’ dislocations are more probable to be mobile, whereas ‘B-type’
and ‘debris-type’ dislocations may have low mobility [34,58] or even
sessile [34,56,57]; consequently, they would function as obstacles to
new dislocations in further straining.
3.2.2. Particles
The HAADF-STEM is employed to detect particles in the extruded
alloy. In the typical XAZM-300 alloy (Figs. 7 and 8), a high density of
disk-phases is observed. They are predominantly distributed within
un-DRXed grains, whereas spherical phases are observed in DRXed
regions. The EDX mapping images show that both types of nanophases are enriched by Al and Ca atoms (Fig. 7(c) and (f)). To incorporate this descriptive information on nano-particles into the strengthening calculation (Section 4.2), the radius (D) and inter-particle
spacing (λ) are estimated. For spherical nano-phases, the D and λ values are directly measured using Image-Pro software; the average values are obtained from 60 measurements on several TEM images. For
disk-shaped phases, the equivalent radius and edge-to-edge interspacing of particles are calculated according to the method introduced in Refs. [59,60]. For example, the mean nano-particle diameters in DRXed grains in XAZM-250 (Fig. 6) and XAZM-300 samples
(Fig. 7) are estimated to be »20 and 25 nm, and the mean inter-spacings are determined to be »53 and 80 nm, respectively. It is presumed that as the forming temperature increases, the nano-phases
grow to some extent.
The atom probe tomography results in Fig. 8 conﬁrm the nanodisc observations in HAADF-STEM and show that the average precipitate compositions are »63 at.% Al, 33 at.% Ca, 2 at.% Mg, 1.5 at.% Zn,
and 0.5 at.% Mn. Indeed, similar ﬁne-scale disk particles have been
typically observed in MgAlCa-based alloys [8,29], and the GuinierPreston (G.P.) zone with an AlCa ratio of 2:1 has functioned as
a precursor [18]. The nano-particles can therefore be determined as
Al2Ca, which evolved from the early-stage G.P. zone. The spherical
nano-particles may have been caused by the growth and/or spheroidisation of disk-phases [1820]. The APT image in Fig. 8 also shows

solute segregation to grain boundaries. The plotted unidimensional
concentration proﬁle across the grain boundary is shown in Fig. 8(c).
The quantiﬁed average compositions of Ca, Al, and Zn atoms are
»3.0, 2.0, and 2.3 at.%, which are several times higher than those in
the grain interiors, respectively.
Apart from nano-particles, Mg2Ca particles in the micron-scale
(0.55 mm) are observed by SEM (Fig. 9). The EDS and mapping
results reveal that the particles contain three elements of Ca
(»21.21 wt.%), Al (»12.46 wt.%), and Zn (»0.44 wt.%). These results
are consistent with previously reported MgAlCa alloys with a similar CaAl ratio [61]. The Mg2Ca particles, however, have a low volume fraction to the extent that they are undetected by the XRD
(Fig. 4). These particles have a considerably smaller size and lower
density than those reported in previous research works based on
Mg3Al1Ca alloy systems [9,19].

3.3. Microstructures of fractured XAZM alloys after tension
In order to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the
deformation behaviour, sample microstructures near the fractured
surface after tensile tests are examined. In the fractured XAZM-250
alloy, the dislocations distribution is considerably similar to that of the
XAZM-250 sample in the as-extruded state. The internal strain is
extremely heterogeneous in the fractured XAZM-250 alloy (Fig. 10(a)),
even in one grain (designated as G1). A considerable quantity of dislocations is observed in Region B (Fig. 10(b)) in G1, and these are predominantly ‘B-type’ dislocations according to the basal-plane-residing
feature (indicated by purple arrows). Although some ‘P-type’ dislocations are found, their density is low (yellow arrows, Fig. 10(b)). In
Region C of G1, only a few dislocations are observed (Fig. 10(c)).
On the other hand, in the fractured XAZM-300 alloy, ‘P-type’ dislocations are considerably more frequently observed among lamellar
sub-grain boundaries (‘G2’, Fig. 10(d) and (e)), which has not been
observed in the as-extruded condition. These ‘P-type’ dislocations
contain screw/mixed-character segments that remain on pyramidal
planes. They differ from the ‘B-type’ dislocations that lie exclusively
on the basal plane without the ‘P-type’ segments. These ‘P-type’ dislocations are exactly the same as the mobile pyramidal dislocations
observed in recent work [34]. Moreover, after tensile testing, the dislocation distribution in the XAZM-300 sample is more homogeneous
than those in the XAZM-250 sample, regardless of whether the
lamellar thickness is between 100 and 300 nm (Fig. 10(d) and (e)) or
»500 nm (‘G3’, Fig. 10(f)). In the DRXed grains of fractured XAZM300, numerous dislocations are also observed (Fig. 11).

4. Discussion
In this work, it is demonstrated that the high strengthductility
synergy can be achieved in low-alloy MgCaAlZnMn samples at
a relatively higher extrusion temperature. The mechanism is discussed as follows.

4.1. Plasticity mechanism
4.1.1. Reduced residual dislocations and high LAGB density
For the XAZM-250 alloy extruded at a lower temperature, the dislocation recovery and dynamic recrystallisation rates are evidently
suppressed [62,63]. As a result, the density of residual dislocations in
XAZM-250 distinctly becomes higher. Similar to previous observations, most of these are ‘B-type’ dislocations [34,56,57].
In general, most residual dislocations can be considered as GNDs
to accommodate local strains. As a result, the residual dislocation
density, rGND., which is directly related to the local misorientation, Q,
can be estimated by the following approach [64,65]:

rGND ¼

2Q
ub

ð1Þ

where u is the unit length of a circuit around a speciﬁc point of interest (50 nm, which is equal to the scanning step length); b is the magnitude of Burgers vector (|b| = 0.32 nm); Q is evaluated from the local
misorientation proﬁle in the KAM map (Fig. 3), which is illustrated in
[66]. According to the Q values (0.85° and 0.53°), the calculated densities of residual dislocations in the as-extruded XAZM-250 and
XAZM-300 alloys are 1.8 £ 1015 and 1.1 £ 1015 m2, respectively.
As the extrusion temperature increases, a typical nano-laminated
microstructure is established in the XAZM-300 alloy. The solute cosegregation and nano-phases are identiﬁed to perform critical functions. In fact, it has been previously demonstrated that the addition
of Ca promotes the activation of basal and/or pyramidal dislocations
in the a-Mg matrix [6]. The new dislocations sufﬁciently interact
with pre-existing boundaries and/or dislocations and rearrange to
form numerous sub-grains by polygonisation. From the kinetic point
of view, the thermal stability of LAGB-dominated grain structures is
considerably enhanced because of the dragging effect of solute cosegregation and nano-phases [67]. The transformation rate from
LAGBs to HAGBs is thus delayed, and the sub-grain growth is
restricted.
Under the foregoing circumstance, the distance between adjacent
LAGBs is short. In the case of high-ductility Mg alloys, the mobile dislocations can easily reach the LAGBs and particular dislocation reactions would occur [68,69], mainly including dislocation nucleation
and/or penetration through the GBs. Kunz et al. proposed that the

penetration mechanism involves the non-conservative motion of dislocations, such as the dislocation climb at grain boundaries, until the
dislocation lines evolve to be parallel with the slip system of neighbouring grains [70]. Recently, Chen and Yu [71], using in situ TEM
experiments, demonstrated that LAGBs can act as a ‘soft barrier’ that
allows the selective transmission of dislocations. Moving dislocations
that have similar orientations with the constitutive dislocations of
LAGBs are allowed to be transmitted, whereas other segments with
larger misorientation are blocked. These results provide direct evidence that LAGBs are capable of hindering the motion of dislocations,
leading to a certain amount of strengthening.
The LAGBs, which differ from HAGBs and are composed of dislocation arrays, may simultaneously function as dislocation sources to
emit new mobile dislocations [68]. Fortunately, the in situ TEM testing in Chen’s work directly reveals that at locations where dislocations are blocked, LAGBs can serve as dislocation nucleation sites
[71]. Under the applied stress, the dislocations are observed to continuously nucleate at particular LAGB sites. Consistent with the foregoing, some possible dislocation emission sites on LAGBs in Cacontaining Mg alloys are marked by asterisks in Fig. 10(e). With new
dislocation emission sites in LAGBs functioning as vehicles of plastic
deformation, the internal strain can be effectively relaxed and
improve the ductility of XAZM-300. Moreover, the dislocation multiplication capability, which is critical to achieve both high strength
and high ductility, may be considerably enhanced in the XAZM-300
alloy. In contrast, in XAZM-250, which has a considerably thicker
lamella and a higher residue dislocation density, the moving dislocations are prone to evolve into the immobile type before reaching the
LAGBs [68,69]. The subsequent emission of dislocations is strongly
restricted, thus leading to the deprivation of dislocation multiplication and low ductility.
4.1.2. Mobile hc + ai dislocation
The ductility of Mg alloys is considerably related to the movement
of stable hc + ai dislocations [56,7274]. Tang and El-Awady [55] facilely demonstrated that the hc + ai dislocation in pure Mg does not
readily dissociate from a pyramidal dislocation to one that is basal;
instead, it transforms from a pyramidal I slip to a pyramidal II slip to
accommodate the strain along the c-axis. By employing in situ TEM
observation, Liu et al. [34] directly conﬁrmed the hc + ai dislocation

mobility in pure Mg pillars. Interestingly, the present work shows
that profuse mobile hc + ai dislocations (‘P-type’) can be activated not
only in submicron-sized Mg pillars but also in polycrystalline Mg
bulk samples.
In the present study, Ca addition is determined to be important to
facilitate the formation of hc + ai dislocations. The possible mechanism involves changing the stacking fault energy [7375] and/or the
resolved critical shear stress of pyramidal planes [55,76]. Recently,
Wu et al. [56] predicted the function of various solutes on the ductility of ternary and quaternary Mg alloys involving Y, Ca, Al, Zn, and
Mn elements by using the cross-slip energy barrier theory. They
showed that solute Y could enhance the ductility via the suppression
of the glissile-to-sessile transition [73,74]. Moreover, they predicted
that MgAlCa, MgAlMn, and MgAlCaMn alloys belong to
high-ductility systems [56]. Consistent with the foregoing prediction,

numerous stable ‘P-type’ hc + ai dislocations are observed in the
MgCaAlZnMn alloy system (Fig. 10(e) and (f)); hence, they
must be intrinsic to the a-Mg matrix [56,73,74].
Even though the composition of XAZM-250 and XAZM-300 are
the same, dense hc + ai dislocations are only observed in the latter
after the tensile test and not in the former. Herein, it is speculated
that hc + ai dislocations might have also been activated in XAZM-250
alloy during tension. Most of the newly formed ‘P-type’ mobile dislocations, however, would easily transform into the ‘B-type’ dislocation
during tension, because high-density residual ‘B-type’ dislocations
would function as strong obstacles and impede dislocation movements [57]. Further, the accumulation of higher density immobile
dislocations is a feedback process, which indicates that the rate of
transformation will increase [57,77]. For example, a high density of
straight hc + ai dislocations up to 1020 m3 has been achieved in pure

Mg at a plastic strain of only 1% [77]. As a result, severe strain incompatibility and high constraint stress are built up, leading to damage
initiation and low ductility in the XAZM-250 alloy.
In contrast, the density of residual dislocations is considerably
reduced in XAZM-300. Under this circumstance, newly activated
mobile ‘P-type’ dislocations are less probable to transform into the
immobile type because of the lower moving resistance. As the extrusion temperature is further increased, the density of residual dislocations in the XAZM-330 alloy is presumed to decrease monotonously,
as evinced by the TEM images in Fig. 5(g)(i). Consequently, a high
elongation value of »12.5% is obtained in the XAZM-330 alloy.
4.1.3. Reduced amount of large eutectic particles
The introduction of intermetallic compounds (IMC) into metallic
alloys can improve the strength of these alloys to some extent
[1012]. Most IMCs are intrinsically brittle, and a high amount of
IMCs in the Mg matrix would invariably reduce resistance to failure
[3843]. Accordingly, we have designed the composition of the
MgCa-based alloy according to the calculated phase diagram
(Fig. 1), and 1 wt.% Al (red dashed line) is selected. On the one hand,
high amounts of micron-scale IMCs have been avoided; a limited
quantity of IMCs have also been broken into particles after extrusion,
as shown in the SEM image (Fig. 9). The localised stressstrain concentration can thus be considerably eliminated [13,1820], and the
early plastic instability can be suppressed [20]. On the other hand,
under this particular composition, numerous Al2Ca particles have
precipitated during the following thermomechanical processing that
is consistent with the calculated phase diagram.
4.1.4. Texture weakening of DRXed grains
Finally, it is also important to achieve compatible deformation
among DRXed grains. As shown in Fig. 11, both the basal and nonbasal slips should have been activated in the typical DRXed grains of
XAZM-300 because of the randomised textures [24,78]. Accordingly,
the strain compatibility in HAGBs would be considerably increased
by slip transfer [72]. The plastic strain can thus be more homogeneously accommodated in this weak-textured XAZM-300 alloy
(Fig. 3) compared to XAZM-250 and previously reported strong-textured MgCa(Sn) alloys [6,46].
4.2. Strengthening mechanism
The major strengthening contributors are identiﬁed to be GBs,
residual dislocations, and homogeneously distributed nano-particles
[6,21,46]. In fact, the typical interaction process among dislocations
with grain boundaries involves the nucleation of new dislocations,
pileups in front of one GB, and the transmission of dislocations
through the boundary [68]. When the extrusion temperature is relatively high, high-density sub-grain lamellae bounded by LAGBs can
be formed, e.g., XAZM-300 alloy. The LAGBs impede the movement of
dislocations and exert a positive effect on strengthening [79]. The

LAGBs with a lattice misorientation of less than 15°, however, usually
possess less resistance to slip transmission than HAGBs [68,69], and
the strengthening caused by the LAGB is speculated to be limited. A
recent research further demonstrated that in the case of LAGB-dominated polycrystalline, a lower strengthening effect results because of
dislocation nucleation and penetration through the GBs [80].
The microstructures of Mg alloys in this study are heterogeneous.
They are composed of both unDRXed regions with a strong ﬁbre texture and DRXed grains with more randomised orientations. In this
sense, the rule of mixture shown in Eq. (2) is employed to predict the
average strength [81]:

s c ¼ s 1  V1 þ s 2  V2

ð2Þ

where s c is the strength of this composite-like Mg alloy; s 1(V1) and
s 2(V2) represent the strength and volume fraction of un-DRXed and
DRXed regions, respectively. Hansen [82] implied that grain boundary and dislocation act as independent and linearly additive contributors to the total hardening in metallic alloys. In view of this, the yield
strength, s ys, of each constituent in the alloy under study can be
expressed as

s ys ¼ s GB þ s dislo þ s Orowan

ð3Þ

where s GB and s dislo represent the strengthening contributions
because of GBs and residual dislocations, respectively; s Orowan represents the Orowan strengthening by precipitates. The hardening in
either DRXed or unDRXed regions may be illustrated as follows.

4.2.1. DRXed regions
In the DRXed region, because of the high degree of recrystallisation, the residual dislocation density is extremely low (< 1012 m2),
and the corresponding strengthening effect is limited. Moreover,
nano-precipitates can impart a strengthening effect via the Orowan
mechanism. For simplicity, the nano-precipitates are presumed to be
bypassed by dislocations, and the Orowan strengthening is calculated
as follows [59]:

λ is the effective inter-particle spacing; r0 is the dislocation core
radius. The precipitates in DRXed grains are usually spherical in this
region (Figs. 7 and 8), and the D and λ values can be directly measured (as listed in Table 2). According to Wang’s research [83], the
basal and/or pyramidal <a> dislocations are dominant in the DRXed
grains of Mg alloys with a weakened texture; hence, Burgers vector
with b = 0.32 nm for the basal slip can be used, and r0 is equal to the
value of b [84]. In the present case, Taylor factor, which is typically a
reciprocal of Schmid factor, is »2.5 with a dominant hai slipping [85].
Precipitation hardening values are calculated to be »89 and 62 MPa
for XAZM-250 and XAZM-300, respectively (Table 1).

The contribution of GBs (in the present case, HAGBs) to hardening
can be obtained as follows.

s GB ¼ s 0 þ ky d1=2

ð5Þ

In Mg alloys, the parameters (friction stress (s 0) and HP-relation
slope (ky)) for grain reﬁnement hardening are texture and grain sizedependent [85,86]. In the basal-textured AZ31 alloy, Yuan et al. [86]
found that s 0 is 208 MPa and ky is 90 MPa¢mm0.5 when the grain size is
ﬁne (< 2 mm), whereas s 0 is 124 MPa and ky 205 MPa¢mm0.5 when
grain size is large (> 2 mm). In this work, with a similar grain orientation of c//RD (radial direction), the texture effect is considered to be the
same as Yuan’s work. The above values can therefore be employed to
estimate the grain reﬁnement hardening effect by ignoring the solute
strengthening difference between AZ31 and the Mg alloy under study
[86]. The contributions of GBs to hardening are calculated to be »381
and 364 MPa for XAZM-250 and XAZM-300, respectively, (Table 2).

4.2.2. Un-DRXed regions
The precipitates in DRXed grains are usually disk-shaped in this
region (Figs. 7 and 8). The inter-particle spacing, λ, and the Orowan
hardening values, which can be geometrically correlated with the
average radius (D), thickness (T), and volume fraction (f) of basal
disks, have been calculated by Wang et al., as follows [59,60]:

are »115 and 91 MPa for XAZM-250 and XAZM-300, respectively. By
accounting for the contributions from s GB and s Orowan, as well as the
volume fraction of DRXed regions, the predicted YS values of XAZM250 and XAZM-300 are »416 and 438 MPa (Table 2), which agree
well with the experimental values in Fig. 2.
Finally, it should be noted that the solute clusters on GBs must provide a certain dragging effect on the dislocation motion and account
for the high strength. Indeed, Sun et al. [89] have demonstrated that
the GB-segregation hardening contributes 3050% to the total
strength of the HPT-processed MgREZn-based alloys, and the high
mix enthalpy values between RE and Zn atoms perform a critical function. Recently, Zhao et al. [90] also reported a periodic segregation
behaviour of Nd/Ag atoms on the twin boundaries (TB) in Mg alloys,
and a strong pinning effect on TB migration has been generated
because of the strong atomic bond between Nd/Ag and Mg matrix.
These GB complexions, as well as the grain reﬁnement, explain the
abnormal strength evolution in the Ca-containing Mg alloys under
study. A higher strength is obtained in the XAZM-300 alloy extruded
at a higher temperature compared to that obtained in the XAZM-250
alloy. On the one hand, when the extrusion temperature is increased
from 250 °C to 300 °C, high-density LAGBs are generated because of
the high degree of DRX, and a more evident grain reﬁnement hardening effect can be achieved (Table 2). On the other hand, the higher contents of solute segregations on GBs should have occurred in the XAZM300 alloy because more distinct solute-atom diffusions are observed in
it than that in the XAZM-250 alloy [24,78]. In this sense, a similar grain

b = 0.61 nm for the hc + ai slip can therefore be used and r0 is 0.83 nm
[60]; Taylor factor with a dominant hc + ai slip is »2.1 [85]. The calculated precipitation hardening values are »84 and 52 MPa for XAZM250 and XAZM-300, respectively, (Table 1).
The GB hardening can be correlated with the average grain size
(sub-grain thickness) via the typical HallPetch relationship (Eq. (5)).
Note that the average grain size should be corrected by a factor of
»1.4 in view of the elongated grain morphology in this LAGB-dominant region [87]. By considering different grain size ranges, the calculated contributions of sub-grains to hardening are »205 and 306 MPa
for XAZM-250 and XAZM-300, respectively, (Table 2).
Furthermore, the hardening contribution from residual dislocations can be evaluated as follows [88]:

where a is a constant (= 0.2), and an M Taylor factor value of »2.5 is
used for simplicity. The calculated dislocation strengthening values

ute atoms (Fig. 8) is expected to exert a considerable strengthening
effect, because the moving dislocations have to break the bonds among
solute atoms existing in the GBs. The high-density GBs and the concurrent GB complexions compensate for the softening resulting from the
dislocation recovery as the extrusion temperature increases; thus, the
high strength in XAZM-300 is preserved.
As the extrusion temperature further increases, the density of
residual dislocations in the XAZM-330 alloy is presumed to decrease
monotonously (Fig. 5), and the corresponding dislocation hardening
is expected to decrease. More importantly, the average DRXed grain
size has increased to »0.61 mm, which is larger than that in the
XAZM-300 alloy (»0.33 mm). Moreover, the sub-grain thickness in
XAZM-330 has grown in the range 300900 nm (Fig. 5), which is
considerably wider than that in the XAZM-300 alloy (as low as
»200 nm). Accordingly, the grain reﬁnement hardening from both
DRXed and un-DRXed regions should be reduced in the XAZM-330
alloy. Combined with the precipitation growth (lower Orowan hardening), the total strength of XAZM-330 alloy would eventually
decrease because of the higher degree of DRX compared to that of
the other Mg samples extruded at lower temperatures.

(1) The XAZM-300 alloy exhibits excellent mechanical properties
with a YS of »425 MPa and an EL of »11%. In contrast, the
XAZM-250 alloy possesses a high YS (»410 MPa) but an
extremely low EL (»1.0%). The key differences between the two
samples mainly involve the size and fraction of un-DRXed grains
and the densities of LAGBs and residual dislocations.
(2) In the XAZM-300 alloy, the high yield strength is preserved
because of the formation of a higher density of LAGBs within the
un-DRXed region compared to that in the XAZM-250 alloy, which
is extruded at a lower temperature. This more evident sub-grain
reﬁnement hardening effect in XAZM-300 is further conﬁrmed
by calculation results.
(3) The leaner alloy additions and higher extrusion temperatures
lead to the formation of dense sub-grains, lower residue dislocations, less coarse particles, and weaker basal textures. These factors combined lead to a considerably enhanced ductility in the
XAZM-300 alloy. The LAGBs may function as dislocation sources
to enhance the dislocation multiplication capability. During postextrusion forming, the lower density of residue dislocations provides fewer obstacles to mobile dislocation movements.
(4) A higher density of stable pyramidal dislocations is observed in
the as-tensioned XAZM-300 alloy than in the XAZM-250 alloy.
These newly activated dislocations provide additional deformation mechanisms along the <c>-direction. Moreover, they are
less probable to transform into the immobile type of dislocations
because of the lower moving resistance in the XAZM-300 alloy.

ABSTRACT
The filing of a patent application for alloy 625 on January 24, 1962, marked the culmination
of nearly a decade of research on the basic Ni-Cr-Mo-Nb alloy system. This paper
describes the research and development effort that resulted in the invention of alloy 625,
how some of the problems that were encountered along the way were solved and how
numerous variants of the alloy were developed. One of the remarkable aspects of the
research effort is that it also resulted in the invention of alloy 718.

Introduction
The development of INCONEL@ alloy 625 (UNS N06625) was started in the 1950s to meet
the then-perceived demand for a high-strength main steam-line piping material. After
several years of discovering how various elements affected the properties and fabricability
of the alloy system, a patent application was submitted on January 24, 1962. Patent
#3,160,500 was issued to H. L. Eiselstein and J. Gadbut on December 8, 1964. The
present composition for alloy 625 is listed in Table I.

The story of the invention and definition of alloy 625 reflects the triumphs, frustrations and
surprises that often accompany the stimulating world of the metallurgical R&D laboratory.
Genesis - The Early Work
In the 1950s there seemed to be an opportunity developing for a main steam-line material
for super critical steam power plants. One such power facility, the Eddystone plant near
Philadelphia, was being built using 316 stainless steel. This plant used 649°C (1200°F)
steam at 13.8 MPa (2000 psi). The product goals for our development were weldability,
high creep resistance, fabricable into tubing, non-agehardening, and otherwise have
attractive ASME Boiler Code design properties, This was to be, what we called, a matrix
stiffened alloy, with a nickel-based composition, Along the way to a product our goals were
modified considerably, except for weldability.
Work had already been done in the 1950s on the strengthening effects of various amounts
of the common major alloying elements, i.e., chromium, molybdenum, niobium* *,
aluminum, and titanium in an INCONEL alloy 600 base. (INCONEL alloy X-750, which is
strengthened by titanium and aluminum, had been around for several years,) The
strengthening effects of these elements one at a time were not impressive. So it was
decided to use molybdenum and niobium in combination with varying amounts of nickel.
Because an alloy goal was metallurgical stability, tensile samples of each alloy were given a
simple aging treatment, such as 704°C (1300°F) for 16 hours, and tested at room
temperature. It was hoped that these tests would indicate any tendencies for age hardening
or embrittlement, which they did in a spectacular way. The net result is shown in Figure
1 .(I) These results delayed the development of alloy 625 and started one which resulted in
INCONEL alloy 718. A patent application for alloy 718 was filed on November. 13, 1958,
and the patent was issued on July 24, 1962 (#3,046,108).

After the hiatus caused by the alloy 718 development, the market for a nickel-based alloy
for super critical steam had vanished. The alloy composition of the matrix-stiffened alloy,
code named MS-2, when development efforts resumed was approximately 60Ni, 1.50,
3Nb, 2M0, OJAI, 0.5Ti and balance Fe. In the annealed state this alloy was a little harder
than alloy 600 and could have been easily fabricated into all standard mill products. Then it
was suggested that the alloy could more readily compete with already established alloys in
the marketplace if it had higher room temperature tensile properties. Fortunately for the
alloy 625 development, the elements chromium and molybdenum that were used to
increase room temperature strength also greatly increased the corrosion resistance. This
change in composition altered the course of development of this alloy and increased its
marketing opportunities. Because of the higher strength there were problems in producing
some products, but weldability was not impaired. The chromium and molybdenum contents
were raised to their current levels of 22% and 9% respectively.
Effects of Elements on Strenath
By using factorial experiments the appropriate levels of niobium, molybdenum, aluminum,
titanium and chromium were determined. The niobium solubility in the alloy appeared to be
about 2.5% and increased with decreasing MO + Cr content. The aluminum solubility was
determined to be about 0.5%.

Little change in properties was noticed with niobium additions up to 2%. Molybdenum
increased the strength of the matrix and may alone or through some interaction with niobium
increase the age-hardening response and decrease the impact strength after exposure.
Increasing chromium content from 16% to 22% caused an increase in the strength of the
4

matrix but did not appear to have any effect on the age-hardening response at these levels
of chromium. Molybdenum, chromium and especially niobium impart creep strength to the
alloy. These effects are shown in Figures 4 and 5.

Figure 4. Creep Tests at 816’C/52 MPa (1500”F/7500 psi)

Aluminum and titanium were intentionally kept low to minimize
the age-hardenability
of the
alloy. Creep tests performed at
649°C (1200°F) showed a considerable benefit, however, in
retaining a level of around 0.2%,
versus O.O%, for each of these
elements. An added advantage
to a low level of AI+Ti was improved weldability and brazeability.
Nickel plating, which
was almost a necessity when
brazing alloys with higher levels
of AI+Ti, was unnecessary.

Stability
Early on, Jim Barker

of the General

Electric

Aircraft

Engines

plant at Evendale,

Ohio, called

our attention to age hardening effects in alloy 625 caused by long-time exposure to
intermediate temperatures. These exposure times were much longer than the 16 hours
5

used in the screening tests and they showed that that composition was quite age
hardenable, but only for uneconomically long aging times of about 200 hours at 649°C
(1200°F). The composition was modified by reducing the amount of aluminum and titanium
in the alloy to the present amount.
In the mid to late 196Os, Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory (KAPL) and the Naval Reactor
Task Force Group expressed interest in large-cross-section
alloy 625 with higher [552
MPa (80 ksi)] yield strength. KAPL proposed increasing the niobium content to 4% or over
but lnco preferred to develop the desired properties by control of thermal-mechanical
processing and heat-treatment. A higher-niobium version of alloy 625 would cause the
usual commercial problems that a new alloy would create, such as duplicate stocking and
segmented market demand, in addition to manufacturing problems such as increased
segregation problems during melting, poorer malleability and resulting lower product yields.
Prior laboratory studies had shown that large sections would require a final thermal
processing step to insure meeting the desired552 MPa (80 ksi) minimum yield strength.
Thermal strengthening was known to be significant but sluggish, occurring in a narrow
temperature range around 649°C (1200°F) with most response within 48 hours. Warm
work aided the strengthening process but inhomogeneous strain could cause considerable
variation in properties from center to edge in large cross-sections.
An annealing
temperature of 871-927°C (1600-1700°F) maximum was required to ensure achieving the
414 MPa (60 ksi) minimum yield strength in large [20.3-254cm
(8-10”) diameter]
cross-sections, while a heat-treatment of 649°C (1200°F) for 24-48 hours was needed to
achieve the 552 MPa (80 ksi) level. Table II gives data for three 25.4cm (10”) hot-pressed
octagons from different heats of material showing the as-pressed, anneale,d and annealed
plus 649°C (12OO”F)/48 hours age properties.

The aging response of alloy 625 is sensitive to annealing temperature, with higher
temperature anneals resulting in less response to direct aging heat treatments in smaller
6

sized specimens. In larger sized specimens [e.g. 254cm (10”) thick] the slower cooling
rate from the annealing temperature permits the material to spend a sufficient amount of
time in the nucleation temperature range of 732-843°C (1350-l 550°F). This dwell time in
this temperature range triggers the precipitation reaction and allows faster growth of
subcritical gamma double prime (y”) nuclei, thus permitting a normal, though slow,
precipitation of the Body Centered Tetragonal (BCT) y” particles during the lengthy aging
treatment at 649°C (1200°F). A time of between 2 and 4 minutes in the critical 760-788°C
(1400-1450°F) temperature range is apparently necessary to cause more rapid aging at
649°C (1200°F).
If smaller diameter samples are given a high-temperature anneal, such as 1149°C
(21OO”F), an extremely long time is needed to produce an aging reaction at 649°C
(1200°F) unless an intermediate nucleation heat treatment of 760°C (14OO”F)/l hour is
performed prior to the 649°C (1200°F) aging treatment. A comparison of aging times
needed to achieve appreciable hardening is shown in Figure 6. After a 1149°C (21 OO”F)/l
hour anneal no increase in hardness was observed after 96 hours at 649°C (1200°F) in a
sample that did not have the 760°C (14OO”F)/l hour nucleation treatment, whereas the
sample that had received the nucleation treatment had an increase in hardness of 11
Rockwell A points after the 649°C (12OO”F)/96 hour age.

Alloy 625 does not precipitate the familiar Face Centered Cubic (FCC) gamma prime ( y’)
found in most AI-Ti hardened alloys, but rather a metastable BCT (y”), which has a
stacking sequence abcdef, and a stable orthorhombic N&Nb phase, with an abab stacking
sequence. The BCT y” phase confers the most strength to the alloy, and it is the phase of
most use in age hardening. The orthorhombic N&Nb phase is not coherent with the matrix
and contributes to hardening only as a dispersant.

The dead-soft base strength of alloy 625 is about 345 MPa (50 ksi) yield strength. While a
minimum room-temperature yield strength of 414 MPa (60 ksi) is achievable in most
cross-sections,
higher minimum values are only achievable by age hardening for
prolonged periods of time, such as 24-48 hrs at 649°C (12OO”F), or by cold working.
Figure 7 shows a plot of room-temperature yield strength after exposure to intermediate
temperatures for various times up to 1000 hours.

The niobium level, with aluminum and titanium being held to low levels, is very influential in
determining the age-hardening response of the alloy. Early in the alloy’s history many
heats were made with the niobium level in the 4.0-4.2% area, while most service or
application data were from subsequent heats that had lower (3.6-3.8%) levels of niobium.
While higher levels of niobium allow increased levels of strength after an aging cycle, the
penalty of decreased room-temperature ductility levels after prolonged service exposure is
not worth the small advantage that the capability of intentional aging provides.
This intermediate-temperature,
sluggish aging response is undoubtedly the major, and
possibly only, drawback of alloy 625. Potential users of the alloy are routinely cautioned
about the loss of ductility after exposure to the 593-816°C
(IIOO-1500°F)
range,

8

Fortunately, the ductility loss is primarily at room temperature - the intermediate
temperature ductility is affected very little as illustrated in Table Ill.

Problems in Sheet

In 1964, Stainless Steel Products Co. (SSP) expressed an interest in alloy 625 sheet for
possible use as engine bleed ducts and bellows on the McDonnell F-4h fighter with new
gas turbine engines. The competing materials were 19-9DL and A-286. The application
involved 566-593°C (1050-l 100°F) and 19.3 MPa (280 psi) pressure. Samples were
provided, and alloy 625 was specified for the application. Several years later SSP were
encountering forming difficulties with Huntington-produced material and samples were
sent to Huntington for evaluation. It was discovered that the nitrogen content of the problem
material was variable and quite high, up to .093%, and that grind marks were contributing to
the crack sensitivity of the sheet. Fortunately, a new sheet/strip facility cured the surface
problem but considerable effort was spent in solving the high-nitrogen problem. The
nitrogen was causing TiN stringers to form, which because of their low ductility were
initiation sites for cracks forming during bending, Modifications of the melt practice reduced
the nitrogen level of future melts of the alloy and eliminated the cracking problem.
However, because of the relatively high levels of chromium and molybdenum in the alloy, it
has a stronger tendency than most nickel alloys to retain nitrogen. The first commercial
heat of alloy 625, made in 1962, was melted in an electric arc furnace and direct-rolled
from the static-cast ingot. Subsequently, melting was done in the electric arc furnace
followed by refining in an argon-oxygen
decarburization (AOD) vessel.
Further
improvements in properties and quality were achieved by remelting in either a vacuum arc
remelt (VAR) or electroslag remelt (ESR) furnace. Certain products, such as sheet and
plate, are usually vacuum induction melted (VIM) and ESR remelted. Virtually all of the alloy
625 produced currently is remelted in either a VAR or ESR furnace. Vacuum melting is very
effective in controlling the nitrogen level in the alloy.
Weldabilitv
Excellent weldability was one of the prime goals in the alloy development program. While
the composition produced a matrix that was essentially a solid-solution type, the presence
9

of a relatively high level of niobium and its participation in a long-time aging-type reaction
created concern regarding resistance to strain-induced cracking during post-weld
exposure to intermediate temperatures. To evaluate this property, Pierce-Miller patch weld
tests were conducted with excellent results. Restrained circular welds were exposed to
1000 hrs at 649°C (12OO”F), repair welded, and then given additional exposures to 649°C
(1200°F) and 704°C (1300°F) with no cracking. Field experience over the last quarter
century reinforces the view that alloy 625 is one of the most weldable of the superalloys.
Additionally, its ability to tolerate dilution by numerous elements has established it as a
premier dissimilar-welding material. For many years, alloy 625 welding products have
been used to weld 9% nickel steel structures that are used in cryogenic applications
because of the high strength, ductility and impact strength of the austenitic-type welds and
the toleration of dilution from the 9% nickel steel.
Corrosion

Considerations

Simply from the composition of the alloy it was recognized that it should have outstanding
corrosion characteristics in many environments even though our initial laboratory tests were
limited to boiling nitric acid. Early evidence of pitting corrosion resistance came from tests
at the Francis L. LaQue Corrosion Laboratory at Wrightsville Beach, NC. Most of the
corrosion data was developed from comparison test coupons of various corrosion resistant
alloys exposed to different environments.
As an alloying element, nickel contributes
resistance to many corrosive media, partitularly to reducing environments, neutral
salt solutions and alkalies and is particularly helpful in preventing stress-corrosion
cracking. Chromium, on the other hand,
offers little resistance to non-oxidizing media such as hydrochloric acid but has excellent resistance to oxidizing solutions
such as nitric acid. Molybdenum, in addition to contributing to mechanical strength
as a matrix stiffener, contributes greatly to
corrosion resistance in reducing media
and in providing pitting resistance. Figure
8 shows how the critical temperature for
pitting increases as the chromium and molybdenum content increases. t2) The antipitting power of molybdenum is illustrated

While excellent strength, oxidation resistance and fabricability of alloy 625 contributed to its
choice for aerospace applications, its superb corrosion resistance has led to a great deal of
success in a wide range of industries. Navy and marine usage is high because of the
combination of high strength and resistance to pitting and stress-corrosion cracking. In
particular, the alloy is used in critical submarine components where reliability in sea water
with crevice conditions is essential. Alloy 625 welding products are often used to overlay
steel power-drive shafting because of their good wear characteristics and resistance to
sea water pitting and crevice corrosion. In nitric acid production the alloy is routinely used
as catalyst grid supports. In the power industry, alloy 625 has been used for many years in
scrubber systems and stack liners. Numerous other corrosion-related applications have
taken advantage of alloy 625’s outstanding and versatile corrosion resistance.

Alloy 625 was invented in the 1950s and was first sold commercially in 1962. In the nearly
30 years since the first production heat of material was melted, over 100 million pounds of
alloy 625 have been produced by nearly two dozen manufacturers. Since that time, there
have been numerous variations of the alloy that have been developed, as shown in Figure
10. The most successful, of course, was INCONEL alloy 718, as described earlier. A
further modification of alloy 718 was alloy 706, an age-hardenable alloy being used for

In order to improve the intermediate-temperature low-cycle fatigue (LCF) properties of
alloy 625, modifications were made to the carbon, silicon and nitrogen levels. By limiting
the carbon level to 0.03% max, the silicon level to 0.15% max. and the nitrogen content to
0.02% max. and by modifying the melting method and annealing practice, a considerable
improvement in LCF strength was realized.
All of this was achieved within the

Over the years in the petroleum producing industry, the depth of oil and gas wells was
increasing and there was more exposure to sour gas environments at higher temperatures.
It was recognized that stronger and more corrosion-resistant alloys would be needed to
withstand these increasingly aggressive environments.
At the time our laboratory in
Huntington lacked the necessary kind of high pressure, high temperature, sour gas
environment capability. We could run the boiling magnesium chloride stress-cracking test
and a room temperature hydrogen embrittlement test. Strip metal test coupons were made
into U-bends of compositions ranging from INCONEL alloy 625 through INCONEL alloy 718.
These were tested for hydrogen embrittlement. The lnco Research and Development
Center in Suffern, NY, was investigating age-hardenable nickel-base alloys for sour gas
use by means of appropriate autoclave technology. The amalgamation of these efforts
resulted in INCONEL alloy 725, which possessed an attractive combination of strength and
sour gas corrosion resistance. Separately, Cartech was developing a similar alloy, Custom
Age 625 PLUS.”
Alloy 725 is strengthened by precipitation of y” during aging. Typical yield strengths of 889
to 1027 MPa (129 to 149 ksi) are obtained by dual aging after annealing, with excellent
ductility values. The alloy is very resistant to sulfide stress cracking in the NACE MR-01-75
environment, stress corrosion cracking in environments containing NaCl, H2S and S at high
pressures and at temperatures up to 246°C (475°F). It also resists pitting and corrosion by
sea water. From a corrosion-resistance standpoint, it is superior to that of age-hardened
alloy 718 and is even more crevice-corrosion resistant in sea water in the age-hardened or
annealed condition than is alloy 625 in the annealed condition,

alloys are listed in Table IV.

Summary
From an initial plan to develop an alloy for service in critical steam applications evolved a
material that is used in a wide range of industries. Alloy 625 is used in the aerospace
industry because of its high strength, outstanding fatigue and thermal fatigue resistance,
oxidation resistance and excellent weldability and brazeability. The ‘outstanding and
versatile corrosion resistance of the alloy under a wide range of temperatures and
pressures is a primary reason for its wide acceptance in the chemical processing field. Its
resistance to stress cracking and excellent pitting resistance in a wide range of water
temperatures have enabled it to be used extensively in nuclear applications. Its choice in
sea-water applications is a result of a resistance to pitting and crevice corrosion, high
corrosion-fatigue
strength, high tensile strength and resistance to chloride-ion
stress-corrosion cracking. It is often used as a welding material to join dissimilar metals
because of its strength and ductility and its ability to tolerate a considerable amount of
dilution from other alloys.
As versatile and impressive as alloy 625 is, one of the truly amazing facts about its
development history is that it was the seed for the development of alloy 718, the most
successful age-hardenable nickel alloy ever developed. Numerous other spin-off alloy
compositions have been, and continue to be, developed. But even after over 30 years of
existence, alloy 625 is still very much alive.

Introduction
PHACOMP has been widely
used for the development
and production
of
superalloys.
According
to the review
by Barrett
(l),
up to this
year,
it
has a history
for a half
century
since 1934 when the paper by Hume-Rothery
et al was published.
Especially
in the last
two decades since Boesch and
Slaney
(2) first
proposed
the idea of PHACOMP based on the electron
vacancy
concept
in 1964, an enormous effort
has been made for developing
the better
PHACOMP. In this method,
the tendency
of the f.c.c.
matrix
(called
y phase)
to precipitate
the undesirable
brittle
TCP phases (e.g.
5 phase) is determined by a magnitude
of the average
electron
vacancy
number, NV.
Here, the
electron
vacancy
number, NV, is the number of vacancies
or electron
holes
in the metal d band above the Fermi level.
In spite
of its successful
applications
to Ni-base
superalloys,
there
still
remain some contradictions
in it.
For instance,
it gives an ill-prediction
for the occurrence
of 0
phase in some alloys
(e.g.
Inconel
713C).
It predicts
poorly
for 1-1phase.
Furthermore,
alloy
design
of Co-base and Fe-base
superalloys
by PHACOMP has
not succeeded
satisfactorily
yet (3).
Most of these problems
are inherent
in the electron
vacancy
concept,
and hence could not be solved
by several
modified
NV methods so far proposed,
The purpose
of this
paper is to propose New PHACOMP to solve
these
problems.
New PHACOMP was developed
on the basis
of theoretical

Recently,
Chelikowsky
(8) proposed
a new approach
for
divalent
alloys
(e.g.
Zn and Cd), following
the Miedema's
semi-empirical
model (9).
But, there has been no solid
theory
so far developed
to treat
of
alloys,
both solute
and solvent
being transition
metals.
In this
case, anisotropic
interactions
due to d electrons
may be dominant
rather
than isotropic
ones stressed
by Miedema, and hence the Miedema-Chelikowsky
scheme
may be no longer
valid
for treating
of the present
problem.
The electron
vacancy
concept
has been used empirically
for this,
but it is less accurate.
As described
before,
the Md levels
physically
correlate
with
electronegativity and metallic
radius
of elements,
both of which are parameters
used in
the classical
approach
by Hume-Rothery
(10) and Darken and Gurry
(11).
Therefore,
the Md has a great
possibility
of dealing
with
the present
solubility
problem.
The values
of Md for various
transition
metals
and Cu, Al
and Si are listed
in Table 1. Each Md is the average value
of eg and t2g.
As the reference,
the zero level
was set to the Fermi level
of Ni3Al.

We assume that when the Md becomes larger
than a certain
value,
the
phase instability
takes place and the second phase occurs
in a Y matrix.
In
other words,
such a critical
Md determines
the solubility
limit
of Y matrix.
The critical
Md value
depends on a type of second phase, because the solubility
limit
is determined
by the tangent
to the Gibbs free energy vs composition
curves
of matrix
and second phase.
As a solid
solubility
changes
with
temperatures,
it should
depend on temperatures,
too.
Such a critical
value
for Md was determined
by fitting
the solubility
line
in phase diagrams
by a constant
Md line,
as explained
in the next section.
It is noted that
Eq.(2)

Discussions

The value of NV is given by the expression,
Nv=10.66
- e/a (e/a:
the
ratio
of valence
electrons
to atoms).
Therefore,
for instance,
the element
Cr, MO and W belonging
to the Via group in periodic
table,
have the same NV
value
of 4.66.
However,
recalling
that there
is a large
difference
in the
atomic
(or metallic)
radius
among these elements
(see Fig.4),
we may see
the lack of atomic
size facor
in NV. This is a shortcoming
as a parameter
exhibiting
a solid
solubility.
For this,
the values
of MO and W have been
sometimes
assigned
to be 9.66.

he history of materials advancement
over centuries has been anchored by
the tenet of utilizing one principal element and adding dilute concentrations
of alloying elements to achieve the properties of interest. The past decade has witnessed a shift toward an alloy design strategy
focusing on the center of multicomponent
compositional space. Termed multiprincipal
element alloys (MPEAs), complex concentrated alloys, or most commonly as a subclass
of these materials known as high-entropy
alloys, some of these materials exhibit exceptional combinations of strength, ductility, and
damage tolerance (1–5). Refractory alloys are
attractive candidates for use at extremely high
temperatures as is demanded by many technology applications, particularly in the aerospace and power-generation sectors (6, 7).
Progress in alloy development in this material class, however, has been slow and stands
to benefit from the MPEA design paradigm.
The desire for materials with thermally stable
microstructures and temperature-insensitive
properties has inspired the development of a
family of body-centered cubic (bcc) refractory MPEAs (7, 8). These alloys made up a
near equiatomic mixture of refractory metal
elements. The high strengths displayed, at high
temperatures in particular, are very attractive
because they surpass state-of-the-art Ni-based
superalloys in some cases, which often lose
strength at temperatures above 1200°C (3, 7).

Alloys that can remain strong at high temperatures enable increased operating temperatures with improved efficiency in a variety
of energy, aerospace, and nuclear applications. Alloys with the bcc crystal structure,
including steels, are ubiquitous. These alloys
are the foundation of a vast array of structures
and technologies because of their economies
of scale. However, conventional bcc alloys are
plagued by a pronounced dependence of the
mechanical properties on temperature, which
often manifests as a ductile-to-brittle transition with decreasing temperature. The origin
of this behavior is linked to the sluggish motion of screw dislocations, which are linear
crystalline defects that allow plastic strain
accommodation, owing to the nature of the
atomic bonding at the dislocation core, and/or
embrittlement by interstitial elements such as
C, O and N. Increasing temperature mobilizes
screw dislocations (in a catch-up game with
their edge dislocation counterparts) to enable
noncatastrophic shape changes, albeit at the
expense of strength. In contrast to many bcc pure
metals and dilute alloys, some bcc refractory
MPEAs such as MoNbTaW and MoNbTaVW
exhibit a gradual decrease of strength with
increasing temperature and even a strength
plateau in the intermediate temperature range
of 600° to 1000°C (9) (Fig. 1).
The high strength of single-phase bcc MPEAs
is fundamentally related to (i) solute strengthening by the concentrated compositions and
(ii) the variation of core structure along a
screw dislocation due to local chemical fluctuations (10, 11). Both phenomena suggest
that the thermally activated kink nucleation
on a screw dislocation is not necessarily the
rate-limiting step for dislocation motion, as
it is for simple bcc metals (12), leading to the
prediction of a weak temperature dependence

Refractory multiprincipal element alloys (MPEAs) are promising materials to meet the demands
of aggressive structural applications, yet require fundamentally different avenues for accommodating
plastic deformation in the body-centered cubic (bcc) variants of these alloys. We show a desirable
combination of homogeneous plastic deformability and strength in the bcc MPEA MoNbTi, enabled by
the rugged atomic environment through which dislocations must navigate. Our observations of
dislocation motion and atomistic calculations unveil the unexpected dominance of nonscrew character
dislocations and numerous slip planes for dislocation glide. This behavior lends credence to theories
that explain the exceptional high temperature strength of similar alloys. Our results advance a
defect-aware perspective to alloy design strategies for materials capable of performance across
the temperature spectrum.

scopic behavior of different MPEAs (Fig. 1A)
has eluded theoretical interpretations and,
thereby, a clear mechanistic picture. Furthermore, unlike their face-centered cubic MPEA
counterparts, there is limited experimental
evidence of the underlying deformation mechanisms in bcc MPEAs, which thus far does not
sufficiently support some analytical models
(11). For instance, dislocations in the deformed
bcc MPEA HfNbTaTiZr were observed to exhibit a strong screw character (13), a feature
indicating the distinctly easy glide of edge
compared with screw dislocations, in accordance with the classical kink mechanism of
screw dislocations in bcc metals. The dominance of screw dislocations appears to be
incommensurate with theoretical predictions
of dislocations in MPEAs, such as preexisting
kinks on a tortuous screw dislocation and the
retarded motion of nonscrew dislocations.
Both predictions would render dislocation
lines with appreciable deviations from a pure
screw orientation. Taken as a whole, the current picture depicted by experiments suggests that classical bcc dislocation mechanisms
(Fig. 1C), with only subtle augmentations,
are operative in MPEAs. This would be an unexpected finding, given the ruggedness of the
atomic landscape that dislocations must navigate in these alloys (Fig. 1D).
A robust understanding of the mechanistic origin of the distinctive properties in the
bcc MPEAs that exhibit weak temperaturedependent behavior would greatly inform alloy
design principles. We experimentally demonstrated a striking departure from conventional
bcc dislocation behavior in the MPEA MoNbTi,
an alloy that shows decent strength at low temperature and an intermediate temperaturestrength plateau yet a considerably lower
density (r = 7.67 g/cm3) (Fig. 1, A and B) (14).
Moreover, the combination of these three
elements reflects one of the most frequently
used base blocks of the reported refractory
MPEAs (7), among which are the ductile and
strong examples of HfMoNbTiZr and MoNbTiV. We focused on elucidating the intrinsic
capacity for plastic deformation by dynamically
probing dislocations in the single bcc phase
and single-crystal environment, at equiatomic
composition with global randomness (Fig. 1, E
and F). Experiments were performed at room
temperature [0.12 melting temperature (Tm)],
which is below the classical transition temperature of ~0.2 Tm (12, 15), at which thermally
activated kink-pair nucleation ceases to be
the rate-limiting step. This temperature enabled us to probe differences in the dislocation slip behavior in MPEAs and conventional
bcc metals. Our results highlight multiplanar,
multicharacter dislocation slip in MoNbTi, encouraged by the broad dispersion in the glide
resistance for dislocations, due to the atomicscale chemical fluctuations. The ability of

dislocations to choose the easy gliding direction and plane in the random field of
multiple atomic species enables an excellent
combination of strength and homogeneous
plasticity in this alloy, traits that are not
simultaneously observed in conventional
metallic alloys.
Characterization of dislocations
after nanoindentation

We first select the multiaxial stress state imposed during indentation, as it provides an
avenue to investigate all potential configurations of dislocations. The microstructure of
the as-processed MoNbTi is initially free from
dislocations, as demonstrated by the uniform
contrast outside the plastic zone created by
the indentation (Fig. 2); thus all the dislocations we observed underwent glide to their

rest positions. Detailed analyses of the dislocation Burgers vector and line direction were
performed in an area containing discernable
individual dislocations (tables S2 and S3). We
identified two groups of dislocations with
the Burgers vectors of 1=2½111 and 1=2½111,
respectively. The segments of the 1=2½111
dislocations that lie roughly vertical in the
images are close to screw character, whereas
the segments that are approximately horizontal are close to edge character. The morphological deviation away from a straight pure
screw orientation indicates a substantial tortuosity with segments of nonscrew character
along the otherwise rectilinear screw dislocation (fig. S2). Dislocations #2 to #6 are close
to pure edge ones and exist on distinct slip
planes, including (211), (321), and (110). Dislocations #7 and #8 have one segment of edge

or mixed character (roughly horizontal in
the images) and the other segment close to
screw character (roughly vertical in the images),
with both habiting the (110) plane. The dislocations in the second group have a Burgers
vector of 1=2½111 and are parallel to each other,
as represented by dislocation #9 (Fig. 2F).
These dislocations appear at an angle to the
projection of their Burgers vector 1=2½111 at
the diffraction condition of g3 (Fig. 2D), indicating that they are all mixed dislocations.
Both the presence of substantial nonscrew
segments and high-order slip planes are unexpected for bcc metals at such low homologous temperature (0.12 Tm). Furthermore,
dislocations #1 to #8 have the same Burgers
vector and are subjected to a similar stress
state on the basis of their close proximity to
each other, suggesting that the propensity of

dislocations to glide on various planes may
be similar.
Dislocations during single-crystal
tensile deformation

We assessed the dynamic behavior of dislocations during plastic deformation using quantitative in situ tensile tests, which revealed
cross-slip and bowing of dislocations, providing key insights on the mechanisms mediating
dislocation glide. We conducted tensile loading of the single-crystal sample close to the
[001] crystal direction, resulting in equal resolved shear stresses (RSSs) along all four possible h111i Burgers vectors. We quantitatively
determined the full crystallographic characteristics of the gliding dislocations, including
Burgers vector, slip plane, and line direction,
with high fidelity (14) and uncovered the substantial nonscrew character of gliding dislocations in MoNbTi (Fig. 3). All of the dislocations
shown in Fig. 3 glide along the traces at the
same angle of −61° to the tensile direction,

corresponding to a distinctive 1=2½111ð213Þ
slip system (table S4). We reconstructed the

line morphology of dislocation (iii) at three
sequential positions of the line during glide
in Fig. 3G, demonstrating the evolution from
almost pure screw dislocation to a serrated line
and eventually to a more smoothly curved line.
These observations suggest that the critical
stress to move edge or mixed dislocations is
not distinctly lower than that to move screw
dislocations, which is not the case for conventional bcc metals at low homologous temperature. Rather, in conventional bcc metals,
dislocations remain in a pure screw orientation as they migrate, because the nonscrew
segments can glide away easily (12).
With increased stress from 812 to 938 MPa
(Fig. 3, A and B), we observed highly variable
motion among seemingly identical dislocations. Many dislocations [such as dislocation
(i)] glide to the upper edge of the specimen
and create long traces, whereas other dislocations [such as dislocations (ii) and (iii)] glide
for only a short distance. Usually heterogeneous stress fields created by nearby defects
would explain such variability, yet the defect
environment in this region is not appreciably

different. The different gliding behaviors of the
dislocations in the same slip system suggest
variations in the local lattice resistance for dislocation slip, originating at the atomic scale and
not detectable at the current magnification.
Distribution of slip activities on
high-order planes

The experimental observations of dislocations
possessing largely nonscrew character on highorder slip planes are statistically robust over
the course of loading and are homogeneously
distributed across the entire single crystal (region that measured ~5 by 5 mm gauge) (Fig. 4),
suggesting that successive source operation
on a single plane leading to heterogeneous
avalanche behavior is not favored. The single
crystal yields at 812 MPa under tensile loading
along the [001] crystal direction, which, upon
considering the largest Schmid factor of m =
0.49 in the single crystal, agrees well with the
measured bulk polycrystal compressive yield
strength of 1100 MPa for MoNbTi (Fig. 1A).
This comparison results in a Taylor factor of
2.76, which is in the range of 2.75 to 3.06 for

typical bcc metals and close to 2.73 calculated
for polycrystalline bcc metals deforming by
pencil glide (16). Therefore, the activation of
slip systems in the microtensile specimen is
representative of that in a bulk polycrystalline material. The individually determined
slip systems are active across the stress range
without exhaustion (Fig. 4F). All of the measured slip traces are linked to high-order slip
planes of {112}, {123}, and even {134} types.
To determine the origin of the glide-plane
selection, we carried out a Schmid factor analysis for all recorded slip traces. Most of the
active slip systems have high Schmid factors
(0.42 to 0.49), with only a few systems having
low Schmid factors (0.26 or 0.29) (table S5).
We did not observe traces corresponding to
the commonly considered {110} slip planes,
even though some of these systems exhibit
relatively high Schmid factors of 0.36, 0.40,

or 0.45. The unexpected result of the selection
of high-order slip planes with high Schmid
factors could be rationalized by composite
(effective) slip on various {110} planes through
facile cross-slip. However, the absence of the
traces of {110} slip systems with equally high
Schmid factor (0.45) indicates that the slip
resistances on the various high-order planes
are comparable if not even lower, thereby
favoring high-order planes. Additionally, our
observations of mixed-character gliding dislocations would preclude the copious crossslip of screw dislocations required to give
rise to slip on effective (noncrystallographic)
high-order planes according to the maximum
RSS plane criterion (17). Considering the complex atomic distribution in MPEAs, our results
motivate the hypothesis that the probability
of moving dislocations on the observed highorder crystallographic slip planes is similar

to or even higher than that on {110} planes,
promoting slip selection on a widespread basis
and uniformly over the crystal.
Slip resistance for dislocations in MoNbTi

In light of our experimental evidence for the
nonscrew character of dislocations and the
multiplicity of operative slip systems, we focused on the origin of the slip resistance for
the edge and screw dislocations on different
slip planes. Atomistic simulations reported the
decreased ratio of the critical stress required
to move screw and edge dislocations on {110}
planes in NbTiZr, relative to conventional bcc
metals and alloys, owing to the fluctuations
of solute concentration (10) and the varying
energy barrier for kink migration in a random
solute environment of MPEAs (18). Our results
suggest that examining only the common {110}
slip planes in bcc MPEAs does not suffice in

accurately representing the three-dimensional
fluctuation of chemistry. Reminiscent effects
have been reported in NiAl hosting the B2
crystal structure (19), in which the Peierls
stresses for screw and edge h111i dislocations
were shown to be very similar on {112} planes,
whereas they have a ratio of ~29 on {110}
planes, and the Peierls stress for screw dislocations on {112} was slightly smaller than
that on {110} planes.
We performed atomistic simulations to calculate the slip resistance in MoNbTi for screw
and edge dislocations on {110}, {112}, and {123}
planes. To reflect the influence of the local
atomic environment and account for statistical fluctuations, calculations were performed
by enforcing a short dislocation segment of
length 3b to 4b (b is the magnitude of Burgers
vector) to glide on the respective slip plane by
one lattice periodicity, with multiple enumerations using different simulation cells. Each cell
contains atoms that were randomly assigned to
a bcc lattice on the basis of the equiatomic
composition. The calculated slip resistance is
akin to a Peierls stress in elemental and dilute
alloys but, in MPEAs, is more accurately termed
a local slip resistance (LSR), as it accounts for

the periodic energy landscape of the crystal
lattice as well as any local solute environment
sampled by a dislocation as it moves in the
globally random structure.
The computed LSR values have a broad distribution (Fig. 5) in contrast to the deterministic value in pure metals (the Peierls stress
in a homogeneous lattice). The substantial
variations result in dislocation glide of a
probabilistic nature. Among the simulated
dislocations, the lowest stress to move a dislocation (of edge character) can occur on either
{110}, {112}, or {123} planes depending on the
local atomic configuration. We observe that on
the {112} planes, certain local atomic configurations can bear an LSR that is lower for
screw dislocations than for edge dislocations.
The dislocation slip asymmetry, owing either
to twinning–anti-twinning asymmetry known
for {112} planes (17) or to a shear in a positive
or negative sense on other planes (Fig. 5B),
also takes on a probabilistic nature. Slip in the
anti-twinning direction is not always harder
than in the twinning direction on {112} planes,
as is the case for conventional bcc metals.
Taken as a whole, the diminished distinctions
between slip planes, dislocation characters, and

for dislocation slip, which is desirable for plastic formability and damage tolerance.
Discussion

Despite the decreased difference between the
LSR to move screw and edge dislocations in
MoNbTi, slip still occurs primarily by edge
dislocations. What is distinctive to bcc MPEAs
is that the straight screw dislocation could
have a varying core structure along its line
due to the local chemical fluctuations. As a
result, the barrier for kink nucleation may be
lowered, and kinks could even be preexisting
(10, 20, 21). Once kinks are present on a screw
dislocation on any of the {110}, {112}, and {123}
planes, the edge character dislocation segments
would glide on the slip plane that locally have
the lowest resistance. On the basis of the
series of simulations performed in MoNbTi, it
appears that gliding on {123} planes is statistically the easiest (Fig. 5C), which agrees with
the experimental observation that the active

slip system at yield is 1=2½111ð213Þ
(Fig. 3).
Using the 812-MPa tensile yield stress of the
experimental specimen and the Schmid factor
of 0.49, we determined the RSS on the slip

system to be 398 MPa. Compared with the
computed LSRs, it is highly likely (at a probability of ~0.8) that the RSS is sufficient to activate edge dislocation motion on {123} planes.
Together with the dominance of nonscrew
segments on the observed dislocation lines,
this quantitative comparison demonstrates
that the high slip resistance of edge dislocations controls the yield stress in this alloy. On
the other hand, rather than material softening
by opting for the weakest link of gliding dislocations, the variation of the LSR in the same
glide plane serves to suppress dislocation runaway and localized plastic flow, which is exhibited both as the increased tortuosity of the
dislocation line and as multiple slip events in
the crystal. Consistent with the statistical analysis of our experiments (Fig. 4), the traces of
various slip systems are homogeneously distributed in the region on multiple high-order
planes, and no localization is observed up to
600 MPa beyond yielding.
The probabilistic glide on {110}, {112}, {123},
and even {134} planes can contribute to retained strength at elevated temperatures,
before the onset of diffusion-controlled dislocation glide/climb around 0.5 to 0.6 Tm (22).
The efficacy of the solute-strengthening mechanism decreases with increasing temperature,
because it is a thermally activated process by

[111] direction, it is the twinning sense on ð112Þ plane and is denoted as the positive
sense on ð110Þ or ð123Þ plane. If the shear is in the ½111 direction, it is the anti-twinning
sense and negative sense on the respective planes. Only the results of stably gliding
dislocations are shown in the plot. (C) Cumulative distribution of the LSR values for edge
dislocations is plotted. The experimentally determined resolved shear stress on the

nature. The alternative strengthening mechanism of dipole dragging on screw dislocations depends weakly on a temperature below
~0.6 Tm, because it is based on the elastic
interaction of dislocation segments. Frequent
kink formation on different planes and the
subsequent glide of the edge or mixed kink
dislocation on different planes (10, 23) are
prerequisites for edge dipole formation, so the
chances are greatly enhanced in MoNbTi by
the activities on a large number of slip planes.
The operation of dipole dragging strengthening, paired with the low extent of thermal
elastic softening in the refractory bcc alloys (24),
is likely responsible for the strength plateau
in the intermediate temperature regime of
MoNbTi (Fig. 1). However, the multiple operative slip planes may not be common in all bcc
MPEAs, as evidenced by the diverse strengthtemperature dependence (Fig. 1). This promotes the need to understand and even tailor
the extent of dipole dragging and hence its
contribution to hardening through a defectaware alloy design strategy.
Our study reports clear, albeit unexpected,
evidence for (i) a large fraction of nonscrew
segments on the gliding dislocations in a bcc
refractory MPEA at a low homologous temperature of 0.12 Tm, (ii) the importance of highorder slip planes in bcc MPEAs, and (iii) a

probabilistic description of the slip resistance
in random alloys. These results constitute the
mechanistic basis that can explain the high
strength and homogeneous plasticity of this
alloy at a low homologous temperature, and
they contribute to understanding its weak temperature dependence of strength. All three features are desirable for applications exposing
materials to extreme temperatures yet are not
simultaneously attainable in traditional refractory metals or alloys. These insights pave the
way for theory-guided exploration of new alloys
in the vast compositional space of MPEAs, as
the multicharacter and multiplanar nature of
dislocation slip could be employed as a mechanistic fingerprint for material screening. At a
fundamental level, a probabilistic description
of the traditional Peierls stress of dislocations
owing to the fluctuating chemical landscape
at the atomic scale should be brought to the
forefront when designing new MPEAs.

Pathways for ductility
Alloys containing multiple elements can be very strong but often suffer from poor ductility. F. Wang et al. found
that different mechanisms accommodated plasticity in a molybdenum-niobium-titanium multiprincipal element alloy (see
the Perspective by Cairney). Instead of so-called ''screw'' dislocations, deformation is accommodated by multiple
pathways that include ''edge'' dislocations and activation of crystallographic slip planes. These results offer a design
paradigm for developing new high-strength alloys.

Abstract: For advanced anode materials involving alloy/dealloy chemistry for potassium ion batteries (PIBs), twodimensional (2D) bismuth subcarbonate (BCO) nanosheets
that possess high theoretical capacity of 631 mAh g1 are
proposed. The large lattice spacing of 0.683 nm along b axis
facilitate insertion of K+ ion to boost high-capacity delivery of
ca. 610 mAh g1, and the in situ nano-crystallization well ease
volume changes of the integrated particle and shorten ion
diffusion path during potassiation/depotassiation. After coupling with a concentrated KFSI-G2 electrolyte, the robust and
efficient SEI built from enhanced participation of FSI
synergistically endow structural stability of the flower-like
BCO, and enable a prolonged cycling performance with
capacity of ca. 300 mAh g1 at 0.2 A g1 for 1500 cycles,
achieving an ultralow decay rate of 0.007 %. Mechanistic
investigations probe the electrochemistry involving alloy/dealloy and phase transition of the electrode.

Introduction
Potassium ion batteries (PIBs) have received increasing
research attention in the past years due to the favorable
standard redox potential of K+/K (2.93 V versus SHE, close
to 3.04 V of Li+/Li) and competitive reserve in the earths
crust of 17 000 ppm for K element, which have been regarded
as one of the most promising alternatives to lithium ion
batteries that are increasingly challenged by uneven distribution and reserve shortages (20 ppm) of Li.[1–4] However, safety
concern associated with the highly reactive potassium metal
has raised urgent requirement to search suitable anode
materials as potassium ion host. The satisfying anode

materials are expected to have high capacity and favorable
working potential with low voltage polarization and potassiation voltage higher but near to K+/K couple[2, 3] in order to get
high working voltage and high energy density/efficiency for
the integrated full cell. Pioneering work associate with anode
materials for PIBs by Ji and co-workers,[5] graphite featured
with potassiation/depotassiation potential at ca. 0.2 V have
stimulated development of other carbon materials including
graphene, hard carbon, and so on.[5–8] However, their limited
theoretical capacity or slope potassiation/depotassiation behaviors make their employment hesitation in PIBs. Anode
materials involving alloy/de-alloy mechanism, such as Sb,
Sn[9–11] and Bi, are considered as promising candidates due to
their favorable potassiation/depotassiation potential and
enriched K+ ion incorporation.[3] The well centralized potassiation/depotassiation behaviors within 0–1.5 V versus K+/K
and higher capacity contribution below 0.5 V made bismuth
stand out. Very recently, applications of bismuth metal as
anode materials for PIBs[12] have motivated development of
bismuth containing compounds including Bi metal composites,[13–15] Bi2S3,[16] Bi2Se3,[17] etc., and various approaches
including carbon coating/encapsulation,[13, 17, 18] nanostructure
design,[14, 15] element engineering[19] have been reported to
resolve the huge volume expansion of ca. 400 % upon
transition from Bi to K3Bi. However, the limited lattice
spacing, and sulfur/selenium related conversion electrochemistry above 1.5 V versus K+/K could cause fast capacity decay
or compromise energy efficiency of the integrated full PIBs.
Therefore, it is meaningful to modulate the conversion-type
reaction for bismuth-containing compounds and to probe the
evolution of crystal grain during potassiation/depotassiation
and its effect on structural stability of the electrode.
The interphase chemistry correlated with electrolyte and
electrode materials is considered as another factor that plays
a key role in chasing high performance of K+ ion storage.
Electrolyte recipe regulation has been a main-stream approach to construct the solid interphase film (SEI) on the
electrode, which is responsible for the ion transport and
electron inhibition between electrolyte and electrode.[1, 4]
Ether, such as dimethyl ether (DME) has been generally
validated to build satisfying SEI on the anode electrode and
guarantee K+ plating/stripping comparing with the esters, and
potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (KFSI) based electrolyte
has been commonly used due to its high conductivity and
solubility.[20–24] When call back to the solvation chemistry in
the electrolytes, coordination compatibility of the solvent
molecular with solute should be brought to the forefront,

which could influence electrochemical behaviors and further
affect the electrochemical performance of the electrode.[25] It
is noticeable that the reported bismuth-contained anode
materials generally experienced capacity decay and their
long-term stable performance have been mostly around 500
cycles, rarely reaching 1000 cycles. The structural stability of
electrode materials and their interfacial stability that correlated with the composition and structure of SEI are considered to be among the factors that should shoulder the
responsibility.
Here, a hierarchical bismuth subcarbonate (BiO)2CO3
(defined as BCO) with flower-like morphology was fabricated
and firstly applied as promising anode material for PIBs. The
hierarchical BCO constructed by two-dimensional (2D) nano
sheet have a high theoretical capacity of ca. 631 mAh g1
based on transition to (K2O + K2CO3 + K3Bi) and the lattice
spacing of 0.683 nm along b-axis could facilitate fast K+ ion
insertion and diffusion in the crystal grain. A 5 M concentrated KFSI-G2 electrolyte was developed, where the G2 with
long chain could couple the large-sized KFSI in solvation, and
the participation of FSI anion in SEI formation was
promoted due to absence of free G2 molecular upon high
concentration, which resulted a thin but robust SEI that
contained rich inorganic species, in comparison with the
dilute recipes and KPF6-carbonate electrolyte. An in situ
nano-crystallization originated from alloy of bismuth with K
in the crystal could shorten ion diffusion in the host grain and
enable structure stability of the integrated particle. Using 5 M
KFSI-G2 electrolyte, the BCO electrode exhibited high
reversible capacity of 610 mAh g1 and retained capacity of
430 mAh g1 after 120 cycles at current density of 0.025 A g1.
Noticeably, the BCO based electrode could maintain capacity
of ca. 300 mAh g1 for over 1500 cycles with decay rate of
0.007 %, a satisfying long-term stable performance that has
been rarely reported for anode materials involving alloy/dealloy chemistry. The K+ ion storage mechanism was probed
via in situ/ex-situ XRD and Raman, that BCO process along
alloy/de-alloy of Bi with K following a conversion-type
reaction, for which DFT calculation further give support
from atomic/molecular level. The well-defined plateaus at ca.
0.3 V/0.55 V of BCO anode enabled the full PIB coupled with
PTCDA cathode to perform with narrow voltage hysteresis
and a high energy efficiency of ca. 82 %. The integrated full
cell delivered a capacity of 530 mAh g1 at 0.01 A g1 and
stably maintained capacity of ca. 225 mAh g1 at 0.03 A g1
for over 100 cycles. The pouch battery of BCO further
demonstrated its potential for practical application. This
work opened a new sight for construction of high stable anode
materials in PIBs and could provide a new view for the
interphase chemistry correlated with its effect on prolonged
cycling performance.

with [Bi2O2]2+ cation to precipitate as BCO in basic condition.
The obtained BCO with flower-like morphology was integrated by 2D nano-sheet (Figure 1 a–c; Supporting Information, Figure S1a) and the diameter of one single flower
particle is around 1 mm (Figure 1 b). The peaks in XRD
pattern of BCO can be indexed to be hexagonal (BiO)2CO3
(JCPDS No. 84-1752) (Figure 1 d). The interlayer distance
along b axis is ca. 0.683 nm, which is confirmed by HRTEM
images shown in Figure 1 e, and the measured angle of (040)
plane and (161) plane was 498, which well agreed with the
feature of orthorhombic system. The XPS results demonstrated typical spectra of BCO (Figure 1 f,g; Supporting
Information, Figure S1b).
The electrochemical behavior of the obtained BCO was
initially evaluated in the half cell coupling with K metal and
various concentrations of KFSI in G2 (diethylene glycol
dimethyl ether) together with 0.8 M KPF6 as electrolyte. The
G2 with long chain structure was used to well solvate the
potassium salt considering the large size of KFSI, which has
been rarely dealt with before.[26] As Figure S2a demonstrated,
after KFSI addition, the peaks corresponding to CH2 rocking
and C-O stretching vibration at ca. 820 and 850 cm1 of free
G2 molecular weakened remarkably, indicating that G2
molecular well solvated with K+, and the peak at ca.
720 cm1 corresponding to S-N stretching mode of FSI

shifted to higher wavenumber along with concentration
increasing, similar to the results reported previously.[21] And
the peak belonging to FSI in 1 M KFSI was narrowed
comparing with that of the reported case using DME, which is
associated with the superior solvation of G2 to DME, leading
to more restricted stretching of FSI ion in G2 system.[27]
Thus, upon high 5 M concentration, most solvent molecular
solvated with the K+ ion and their decomposition was
inhibited, and participation of FSI- anion in SEI formation
was enhanced. Theoretical calculation result shown in the
Supporting Information, Figure S2c,d probed that the LUMO
of KFSI-G2 complexes are mainly contributed by FSI ,
indicating that FSI would be preferentially reduced in
formation of SEI.[24] Compared with KFSI-DME couple, the
higher binding energy for KFSI-G2 than KFSI-DME
(1.97 eV versus 1.87 eV) indicates stronger interaction
between KFSI and G2,[28] which was attributed to the well
match degree between long chain of G2 and large sized KFSI.
And the enlarged gap between LUMO and HOMO for KFSIG2 complex comparing with KFSI-DME (0.65 eV versus
0.285 eV) (Supporting Information, Table S1) could partly
enhance the electrochemical stability of KFSI-G2.[24] For
Raman result of 0.8 M KPF6-EC-DEC electrolyte shown in
the Supporting Information, Figure S2b, the peaks located at
ca. 716 cm1 and 893 cm1 were attributed to C=O bending
mode and ring-breathing mode of the solvent molecular,
respectively,[29] and the peak at ca. 741 cm1 was speculated as
the interaction between KPF6 and EC-DEC, based on Raman
response of PF6 ion at ca. 750 cm1 and the interaction of K+
with solvent molecular.[29, 30]
Figure 2 a shows the differential plot of half-cell of BCO
electrode (80 wt % BCO), which exhibits potassiation behaviors similar to alloy/de-alloy chemistry of Bi with K at
potentials of ca. 0.7 V and ca. 0.4 V except a slope featured
process, and the de-potassiation process also shows a mellow
process below ca. 1.2 V,[12–15] after which the slope process was
attributed to a converse process that happened in potassiation
above ca. 0.9 V. Differential plot derived from galvanostatic
charge/discharge curve (inset in Figure 2 a) demonstrated that
the peaks corresponding to potassiation/de-potassiation plateaus of BCO well concentrate in 0–1.5 V versus K/K+,
a satisfying feature for candidate used as anode materials. The
well concentrated potassiation/de-potassiation behavior below 1.5 V with a well-defined long plateaus enables BCO
a promising anode material for PIBs, and the satisfying
potassiation voltage of the plateau at ca. 0.4 V endows BCO
anode with superior talent to avoid K metal deposition.[12, 19]
When the 5 M KFSI-G2 was used as electrolyte, an initial
Coulombic efficiency of ca. 69 % was achieved at current
density of 0.025 A g1, based on an initial discharge capacity
of 1068 mAh g1 and charge capacity of 737 mAh g1, and the
long irreversible plateau during initial discharge could be
mainly attributed to SEI formation.[14–16] The discharged
capacity outperformed theoretical value during the initial
cycles, and SEI rebuilding was considered to be responsible
for this phenomenon. As illustrated in the Supporting
Information, Figure S3a, an in situ nanosized-crystallization
of the 2D nano-sheet can be observed, where the 2D nanosheet block transformed into integration of small particles

with average size of around 10 nm, and the whole flower-like
structure was well maintained. After recharged back to 1.5 V
and 3.0 V (Supporting Information, Figure S3b,c), their
morphology kept almost the same to that of discharged state,
revealing highly stable structure of active material. In
comparison with electrodes coupled with 3 M, 1 M KFSI
and 0.8 M KPF6 electrolyte (Supporting Information, Figure S3d–f), 5 M electrolyte enabled a well legible surface of
the flower-like particle, while coating surface was formed in
both 3 M and 1 M cases, and uneven aggregation was even
observed on the particle surface using the ester electrolyte as
remarked in Figure S3f. The morphology distinction of the
particles was speculated to correlate with varied thickness and
composition of the formed SEI (Supporting Information,
Figure S4), and that uniform participation of the components
in 5 M KFSI-G2 was promoted. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was further carried out upon the
electrodes cycled at the same discharged voltage, to probe the
composition of SEI formed using the four electrolytes. It is
found that organic species were mainly detected in 0.8 M
KPF6 electrolyte (Supporting Information, Figure S5), which
originated from the decomposition of ester solvent, while
existence of F was attributed to the decomposition of PF6
ion.[21, 22] As illustrated in the Supporting Information, Figure S6–8, the content of sulfur containing species increased
along with KFSI concentration rising up, which is evidenced
by enriched C=S group in O1s spectrum, fluorosulfonate
group, SF involved species in S2p spectrum and F1s
spectrum, respectively. The above phenomena reveal that
participation of FSI in SEI formation was enhanced and G2

electrode) was adopted to the further evaluate of its electrochemical performance. At a current density of 0.025 A g1, 11 BCO electrode demonstrated a similar activation phenomenon. Compared with ca. 69 % of the pure BCO electrode, the
initial Coulombic efficiency of 1-1 BCO electrode is ca. 54 %,
and a stable capacity delivery of ca. 455 mAh g1 has been
achieved after 100 cycles (Figure 2 c). Figure 2 d presents the
rate performance of the 1-1 BCO electrode, and the electrode
deliver capacity of 450, 350, 300, 250, 230, 185, 140,
100 mAh g1 at current density of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0,
1.5, and 2.0 A g1, respectively. The corresponding charge/
discharge plots at various current densities are shown in the
Supporting Information, Figure S19b,c. Notably, after charging-discharging at various current densities, the electrode
recovered capacity of ca. 308 mAh g1 at 0.2 A g1 and stably
operated for over 1500 cycles with decay rate of only 0.007 %,
an excellent long-term cycling performance that has been
rarely reported previously in PIBs (Figure 2 e). The well
overlapped charge/discharge curves (Supporting Information,
Figure S19d) verified highly stable and reversible potassiation/de-potassiation behavior during prolonged cycle, which
could be attributed to the in situ nano-crystallization, robust
SEI and conductive network provided by rGO, enabling
stable particle structure and electrolyte/BCO interface for the
electrode. Electrochemical measurements within voltage
window of 0.01–1.5 V for anode materials was also conducted
for the BCO (80 wt %) electrode. Figure S24a in the Supporting Information illustrates the CV curves, in which two
cathodic peaks located at ca. 0.75 and 0.2 V were detected.
These two peaks could be ascribed to alloy of Bi with K, while
another three anodic peaks at ca. 0.7, ca. 0.85 and ca. 1.3 V
could be ascribed to de-alloy of K+.[12, 19] The galvanostatic
charge/discharge curve (Supporting Information, Figure S24b) exhibited plateaus corresponding to the CV result,
and the corresponding differential plot (Supporting Information, Figure S24c) further verified that potassiation/de-potassiation behavior of BCO mainly located within 0.01–1.5 V. At
current density of 0.025 A g1, the BCO (80 wt %) electrode
output capacity of ca. 450 mAh g1 in the initial cycles and
could retain 220 mAh g1 after 200 cycles (Supporting Information, Figure S24d). After the introduction of rGO, the 11 BCO electrode could retain capacity of 400, 330, 300, 275,
250, 200, 150, and 103 mAh g1 at current densities ranging
from 0.05 A g1 to 2.0 A g1 (Supporting Information, Figure S25a–c). Moreover, a capacity of ca. 285 mAh g1 was
maintained when current density returned back to 0.1 A g1,
and ca. 220 mAh g1 was retained after 1000 cycles, with
a decay rate of 0.02 % (Supporting Information, Figure S25d).
The reaction kinetics related with potassiation/de-potassiation behaviors were investigated using electrochemical
methods including galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). As illustrated in
the Supporting Information, Figure S26 a, the quasi-thermodynamically equilibrium potential of BCO (80 wt %) electrode exhibited one slope process and one long plateau at ca.
0.4 V in 5 M electrolyte, and an average K+ diffusion
coefficient (DKþ ) of 7.12  1012 cm2 s1 was achieved based
on Ficks second law (Supporting Information), which was
comparable with the previous result.[16, 22] The results in 3 M

decomposition was depressed when the concentration of
electrolyte changed from 1 M to 3 M, and inorganic species
were dominated in 5 M case with enlarged amount of KF
formation, verifying the intensified decomposition of FSI in
5 M electrolyte, in accordance with theoretical investigation
above.[21, 22, 24] Thus, the SEI composition and its formation
scenario related with participation of potassium salt and
solvents were confirmed by XPS analysis, which further
verified the superiority of 5 M electrolyte KFSI-G2 in
suppression of solvent decomposition, and the results were
in accordance with those of Raman and SEM analysis of the
four electrolyte recipes. Depth XPS were further conducted
to probe the evolution of SEI formation on the electrode
along with cycling, and the SEI film formed on the five
electrodes were verified as constructed with an organic-rich
outer layer and inorganic-rich inner layer (Supporting
Information, Figures S9–S18), which became increasing thick
during the initial nine cycles.
Noticeably, the concentrated 5 M KFSI electrolyte enabled the BCO electrode (80 wt % BCO) retain capacity of
ca. 450 mAh g1 and stably cycled for over 100 cycles with
steady Coulombic efficiency of ca. 99.5 %, and the potassiation/de-potassiation curve of the 100th cycle well overlapped
with that of the 50th (Supporting Information, Figure S19a),
verifying stable electrochemical behaviors in the 5 M concentrated electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry curves displayed
that the anodic/cathodic peaks mainly locate below 1.5 V,
which is consistent with the galvanostatic charge/discharge
test. The superiority of 5 M electrolyte is further illustrated in
comparison with cases using 1 M KFSI-G2, 3 M KFSI-G2 and
0.8 M KPF6-EC/DEC. As shown in Figure S20, among all the
four BCO electrodes, 5 M electrolyte coupled electrode
exhibited most stable cycling performance, highest capacity
delivery and Coulombic efficiency at 0.05 A g1, benefiting
from its robust and efficient SEI constructed on BCO
electrode. The EIS measurements also support the superiority
of 5 M KFSI-G2 among the four electrolytes (Supporting
Information, Figure S21). The similar electrochemical behaviors of the four electrodes in the initial cycles suggested
compatibility of BCO with the ester and ether electrolyte to
some extent. To further improve the electrochemical performance of BCO, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was introduced as conductive additive to build an electron network in
the electrode fabrication procedure, and the electrodes with
BCO/rGO mass ratios of 1-3, 1-1 and 3-1 were employed. As
shown in the Supporting Information, Figure S22, upon same
mass loading of BCO, electrodes with BCO-rGO ratio of 11 and 3-1 both achieved capacity higher than that of 1-3
counterpart (Supporting Information, Figure S22a), while the
1-1 electrode exhibited smaller voltage hysteresis than 31 counterpart (ca. 0.165 V versus ca. 0.205 V) (Supporting
Information, Figure S22b). Figure S22c,d in the Supporting
Information shows the performance of individual rGO
electrode, in which the initial Coulombic efficiency is ca.
40 %, and capacity maintained at ca. 250 mAh g1 after 10
cycles activation. The electrode with BCO-rGO ratios of 11 exhibited the best cycling performance among these three
electrodes (Supporting Information, Figure S23). Therefore,
electrode with BCO-rGO ratios of 1-1 (defined as 1-1 BCO

and 1 M electrolyte displayed similar trend with that of 5 M
case (Supporting Information, Figure S26b,26c), while the
stable DKþ evolution during potassiation in 5 M electrolyte
evidenced the enhanced stability of electrochemical behaviors, and the narrowed potential hysteresis illustrated in the
Supporting Information, Figure S27a–c during the whole
potassiation/de-potassiation suggested more favorable electrochemical reaction in 5 M electrolyte than the other two
cases. The BCO electrodes also achieved more flexible
resistance variation in 5 M electrolyte during alloy/de-alloy
processes (Supporting Information, Figure S27d–f). Compared with the other two counterparts, its high resistance in
the slop process during potassiation/de-potassiation could be
attributed to accommodation for volume change of the
electrode.[31] The DKþ derived from GITT test within voltage
window of 0.01–1.5 V shows similar trend with that of the
0.01–3.0 V case. The average DKþ is determined to be ca.
6.57  1012 cm2 s1 (Figure S28a), which is close to that of
0.01–3.0 V situation. CV curves at various scan rates of 0.02,
0.03, 0.05, 0.08, 0.1 mV s1 were also measured (Figure S28b,c), and K+ diffusion coefficient was obtained based
on the Randles–Sevcik equation (Supporting Information),
where a DKþ value of ca. 0.17  108 cm2 s1, 0.66 
1010 cm2 s1 and 0.17  108 cm2 s1 were obtained for three
peaks located at ca. 0.7, ca. 1.3 and ca. 0.2 V, respectively. The
similar DKþ value belonging to peaks at ca. 0.2 and ca. 0.7 V
suggested well reversibility of the corresponding alloy/dealloy reactions. The discrepancy between DKþ derived from
GITT and CV measurements could be attributed to different
working mechanism of GITT and CV. Thus, the electrochemical kinetics investigations demonstrated that BCO
anode material possessed comparable/better electrochemistry
kinetics comparing with reported materials including selenide,[16] graphite,[22] Bi metal,[32] sulfide,[33] which could be
attributed to the large lattice spacing of BCO and in situ
nano-crystallization, facilitating K+ ion diffusion kinetics in
the BCO electrode.
In-situ/ex-situ XRD together with HRTEM and Raman
measurements were conducted to probe the potassiation/depotassiation mechanism of BCO. As illustrated by the in situ
XRD patterns in Figure 3 a,b, diffraction peaks corresponding
to BCO during discharging experienced a multi-phase
evolution involved potassiation process containing KBi2 (ca.
0.5 V) and K3Bi2 (ca. 0.3 V) during the second long-plateau,
and discharge product of K3Bi was finally formed.[12] Figure S29 presented HRTEM images and selected area electron
diffraction (SAED) patterns of the electrodes cycled to
various states. It can be found that Bi began to form at 0.9 V,
after the first plateau at ca. 1.18 V, which is determined
theoretically to correspond to potassiation of BCO to produce
Bi, K2O and K2CO3. The results based on HRTEM and
SAED pattern illustrated in Figure 3 d,e and the Supporting
Information, Figure S29 agree well with the in situ/ex-situ
XRD analysis. Typically, the discharged electrode at 0.2 V
with two lattice spacing of 0.332 and 0.348 nm could be
ascribed to (1̄30) and (1̄31) plane of hexagonal K3Bi,
respectively, and their angle is determined as ca. 578. During
de-potassiation process, both Bi and BCO were detected at
1.3 V following formation of KBi2 at ca. 1.25 V, and they co-

existed until to 2.0 V and 3.0 V (Figure 3 c and SAED in the
Supporting Information, Figure S29), except for signal of
aluminum substrate. The HRTEM images of electrodes
charged to 2.0 and 3.0 V demonstrated lattice spacing of ca.
0.37 nm, ca. 0.328 nm and ca. 0.237 nm that could be assigned
to (101), (012) and (104) plane, respectively (Figure 3 d, e).
The angles determined to be 558 and 468 are in good
accordance with the feature of hexagonal Bi metal. The
HRTEM images shown in the Supporting Information,
Figure S30a,b indicate that the BCO particle composed of
2D nano-sheets transformed into integration of nanoscale
grains with diameters of ca. 10 to 20 nm after discharged to
0.2 V. Similar result was obtained when charged to 3.0 V
(Supporting Information, Figure S30c), which coincided with
the SEM observation result in the Supporting Information,
Figure S3. The above nano-crystallization could make a structure in situ composed of nano-sized K+ reservoir and the
volume expansion of integrated particle could be relieved,
which endow the BCO based electrode with stable structure
and capacity delivery during prolonged cycling performance.
Figure 3 f schematically illustrated the structure evolution of
hierarchical BCO during potassiation/de-potassiation. It is
deemed that formation process of Bi metal overlapped with
consumption of BCO, and products of K2O and K2CO3
existed as amorphous state, out of XRD detection. Raman
was further employed to examine electrode at 0.9 V during

discharging, and the typical peak located at ca. 1060 cm1
could be indexed to be K2CO3 fingerprint,[34] verifying that
K2CO3 formed after the sloping potassiation process (Supporting Information, Figure S30d). When charged back to
3.0 V, it is found that peaks belonging to K2CO3 vanished,
while Bi metal was determined based on peaks at ca. 97 and
ca. 180 cm1,[35] which is in accordance with the XRD result.
Thus, potassiation/de-potassiation mechanism of BCO was
established as the staged reactions shown below, where the
capacity delivery mainly originated from alloy/de-alloy
chemistry of Bi with K, and a capacitive process was
incorporated via conversion-type reaction involving K2CO3.
However, the electrochemistry related with the highly-active
K2O still needes future investigation, which was not involved
here.

Theoretical investigation based on density functional
theory (DFT) was further conducted to illustrate potassiation
mechanism of K+ ion into BCO lattice. As demonstrated in
the inset of Figure 4 a, after optimization, insertion of K+ ion
expanded the (010) plane and aroused structure evolution to
accommodate the steric effect. K+ ion processed an interaction preference to the single-bond oxygen atom of CO32
layer and then to the bismuth atom of the (BiO)22+ layer at the
transition state (Supporting Information, Figure S31) suggesting priority formation of K2CO3 followed by Bi-K alloy, which
well agreed with the potassiation mechanism proposed above.
At the final state, the inserted K+ preferentially bonded with
single-bonding oxygen atom of CO32 layer, and then
simultaneously bonded with the oxygen and its neighbor
bismuth atom in (BiO)22+ layer with increased bonding
allowing (Supporting Information, Figure S32), providing
evidence for potassiation mechanism that incorporated
K2CO3 product followed by formation of K2O and bismuth
metal. As for two K+ ion insertion (Figure 4 b), similar
phenomena to the case of one single K+ ion insertion
occurred, and the energy level after insertion of two K+ was
near to single K+ ion case, as evidenced by the energy profiles.
The corresponding evolution of bonding priority of the
candidate atoms in BCO with two K was presented in the
Supporting Information, Figures S33 and S34. The layered
structure of BCO was mainly reserved after insertion of two
K+ ion at final state, owing to that the large lattice spacing

along b axis afforded the large-sized K+ ion. The bond length
between the numbered atoms and K at final state and
transition state upon increased bonding allowing, which
correlated with their bonding preference to K,[28] are displayed in the Supporting Information, Table S2–S5. It is
considered that the bonding preference among the candidate
atoms of BCO partly correlated with their respective electron
configuration (Figure 4 c,d). After insertion of the K+ ions, the
distribution of electrostatic potential became more uniform at
the final state compared with both the initial and transition
states, further revealing that insertion of K+ ion was favorable
and helpful for the stabilization of the whole system.[36]
To further preliminarily evaluate the application potential
of BCO anode material for PIBs, full cell was fabricated
(Figure 5 a) coupling BCO/rGO anode with the PTCDA
(perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride) cathode.[37]
The rate performance in Figure 5 b illustrated that a high
capacity of ca. 530 mAh g1 could be obtained at current
density of 0.01 A g1, and the full cell could operate at current
densities upto 0.2 A g1 with capacity of ca. 130 mA g1. It is
noted that after rate performance measurement, the BCO/
rGO jj PTCDA full cell stably cycled for 100 cycles at current
density of 0.03 A g1, which could still maintain a capacity of
ca. 225 mAh g1 (Figure 5 c). The charge/discharge profiles at
various current densities are demonstrated in Figure S35a,b.
The electrochemical behaviors well inherited from those of
the PTCDA half-cell (Supporting Information, Figure S35c,f)
could be attributed to the well-defined plateaus and narrow
voltage hysteresis of BCO anode, and a high energy efficiency
of ca. 82 % was achieved at current density of 0.03 A g1
(Supporting Information, Figure S36). Moreover, a pouch
battery was assembled using BCO electrode coupled with K
foil, which successfully lighted a LED module with nominal
voltage of ca. 2.5 V (Figure 5 d).

Conclusion
Two-dimensional (BiO)2CO3 (BCO) was firstly proposed
as anode material for PIBs. The large lattice spacing of
0.683 nm of layer structured BCO and in situ nano-crystallization originated from elemental distribution of Bi in BCO
well relieved the volume change and enabled structural
stability of the hierarchical material during potassiation/depotassiation. Coupling with a high concentration (5 M) of
KFSI-G2 (diethylene glycol dimethyl ether) electrolyte, the
BCO electrode exhibited potassiation/de-potassiation behaviors below 1.5 V with a well-defined plateau at a safe voltage
of ca. 0.4 V versus K/K+, and achieved satisfying electrochemical performance with capacity delivery of ca.
610 mAh g1 at 0.025 A g1. It is worth noting that a long
cycling performance over 1500 cycles was achieved with
capacity of ca. 300 mAh g1 and low decay rate of 0.007 % at
current density of 0.2 A g1. This accomplishment has rarely
been reported for anode materials involving alloy/de-alloy
chemistry in PIBs. Kinetic analysis results demonstrated that
K+ ion diffusion coefficient of ca. 1012 cm2 s1 was achieved
for BCO electrode. The in situ/ex-situ characterizations
evidenced the staged alloy/de-alloy reactions combined with
a capacitor-like process, which is also supported by the DFT
calculation about the phase transition from atomic/molecular
level. Full cell measurements coupling with PTCDA cathode
and pouch cell application preliminarily exhibited practical
potential of BCO in PIBs. This work opened a new sight for
developing high performance anode materials involving alloy/
de-alloy chemistry in PIBs, and provided a new understanding
about the effect of solvation on SEI formation.

ABSTRACT: Alloying is an eﬃcient chemistry to diversify the properties of metal nanoparticles; however, the
atomic-level understandings of the composition-dependent physicochemical properties and their related biological
performance are presently lacking. Here, we developed a full spectrum of alloy metal nanoclusters (NCs),
AuxAg25−x(MHA)18 (MHA = 6-mercaptohexanoic acid) with x = 0−25, and investigated their compositiondependent antimicrobial performance. Interestingly, we observed a U-shape antimicrobial behavior of
AuxAg25−x(MHA)18 NCs, where the alloy NCs showed decreased antimicrobial ability instead of the common
trend of increasing. Detailed atomic-level characterizations of the AuAg NCs suggest that the decreased performance
of alloy NCs is due to their enhanced stability after alloying, which can deactivate their capability in generating
reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can kill the bacteria. More interestingly, the transition point of the antimicrobial
performance was only obtained with our full-spectrum AuxAg25−x(MHA)18 NCs, which indicates the importance of

Alloy metal NCs normally feature improved physicochemical properties, such as a higher luminescence intensity36−39
and better catalysis activity;40−43 however, their biological
eﬀects are presently unknown.44,45 Recently, we have reported
the antimicrobial ability of Au2546 and Ag25 NCs.47,48 The next
question will be whether the alloy (AuAg)25 NCs would show
a better antimicrobial eﬃcacy? For example, a recent study
found that AuPt nanoparticles showed antimicrobial activity,
while pure Au and Pt nanoparticles presented no activities in
killing the bacteria.49 Interestingly, in the present study, we
found that the alloy NCs gradually lost their antimicrobial
ability compared to their pure Au and Ag NC counterparts. We
further identiﬁed that the loss of antimicrobial ability of alloy
NCs is due to their enhanced stability in solution and in the
biological system, which makes them too inert to undergo a
decomposition process that can provide electrons to generate
reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill the bacteria. Moreover,
diﬀerent from the reported linear trend of optical, electronic,
and catalytic properties over the alloy NCs of diﬀerent
composition,50−52 we observed an unexpected transition point
and a U-shape antimicrobial behavior when we extended the
composition of alloy NCs to a full spectrum. This also suggests

these alloy NCs provides a good platform to understand their
composition-dependent physicochemical properties.26−29
It is well-documented that the physicochemical properties of
alloy NCs are sensitive to their composition, where even one
atom diﬀerence in alloy NCs may lead to signiﬁcant changes in
their properties.8,12,30,31 However, it is still challenging in
developing a full spectrum of alloy NCs. For example, in the
system of alloy (AuAg)25 NCs, two commonly used alloying
methods (co-reduction of Au−Ag precursors and heteroatom
Ag doping into a Au25 template) can only produce Au-rich
alloy NCs or alloy NCs with a broad composition
distribution.10,32−35 Herein, we synthesized a full spectrum of
(AuAg)25 NCs by integrating two synthesis methods in one
NC system (e.g., protected by the same ligand and of the same
size), where a delicate control of the Au heteroatoms can dope
into a Ag25 NC template to generate Ag-rich (AuAg)25 NCs,
and a co-reduction method was used to produce Au-rich
(AuAg)25 NCs.34 In combination, we have established a library
of full-spectrum (AuAg)25 NCs, consisting of nine narrowly
distributed alloy NCs, which cover all composition ranges to
study the composition-dependent properties.

this study, by a delicate control of the amount of Au(I)-MHA
complexes in the heteroatom exchange inside the
Ag25(MHA)18 template (please refer to the Supporting
Information for detailed synthesis procedures). The Au-rich
(AuAg)25 NCs were produced according to the reported
protocol.34 Therefore, we managed to complete the full

methods into one system.
As displayed in Figure 1a, the color of NC solutions changed
from light-brown, reddish-brown, green, and ﬁnally to
yellowish-brown when increasing the Ag amount in the
(AuAg)25 NCs. This color transition was also veriﬁed by
ultraviolet−visible (UV−vis) absorption spectroscopy. As
shown in Figure 1b, the Au25 NCs showed four characteristic

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We successfully built the library of full-spectrum
AuxAg25−x(MHA)18 NCs (MHA = 6-mercaptohexanoic acid)
that contain nine samples with a continuous Au/Ag ratio,
covering the full composition range. The simpliﬁed structures
of each NC are illustrated at the top panel of Figure 1, starting
from Au25 to AuxAg25−x with decreasing Au/Ag ratio (from Aurich to medium alloying and Ag-rich) and completing the loop
with Ag25 NCs. Au25, Ag25, and alloy AuxAg25−x NCs have
identical crystal structures.53−55 Therefore, the only diﬀerence
among the NCs used in our study is their composition, as it
also excludes the other possible inﬂuencing factors such as
surface ligands.56 The as-synthesized metal NCs hold a similar
ζ potential in the range of −36 to −32 mV, which eliminates

absorption spectra in Figure 1b follows the reported
rules.32,34,59 Speciﬁcally, the second last NC sample (x = 1)
showed three distinct peaks at 332, 465, and 600 nm, which
agree well with the reported AuAg24 NCs.7,8
We further used electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
(ESI-MS) to determine the molecular formula of each NC
sample. As shown in Figure 1c, all NC species have been
conﬁrmed to be M25(MHA)18 (M = Au and/or Ag), which
include nine species with a molecular formula of
Au25(MHA)18, Au23−25Ag2−0(MHA)18, Au19−22Ag6−3(MHA)18,
Au15−19Ag10−6(MHA)18, Au10−16Ag15−9(MHA)18,
Au5−11Ag20−14(MHA)18, Au2−7Ag23−18(MHA)18,
AuAg24(MHA)18, and Ag25(MHA)18, respectively. The detailed
analyses are included in Figures S1−S9, and the isotope
patterns of a total of 26 [AuxAg25−x(MHA)18 − 5H]6− species
are shown in Figure 1d. Taking the ﬁrst sample (red line) as an
example, the peak at m/z 1262 in the zoom-in spectrum is
assigned to [Au25(MHA)18 − 5H]6−, and the following peaks
are assigned to the successive coordination of this species with
[+ Na − H] (the full ESI mass spectra and detailed analysis are
included in Figure S1). As for the alloy NCs of mixed
composition, taking the second NC sample (pink line) as an

and the Ag25 NCs have three distinct absorption peaks at 335,
485, and 660 nm (bottom blue line). Both absorption
characteristics agree well with the reported Au25 and Ag25
NCs.53,54,57,58 For the alloy (AuAg)25 NCs, the mixing between
Au and Ag states has perturbed the discrete energy levels of the
NCs, and the continuous doping of Ag atoms inside the
(AuAg)25 NCs can modulate their electronic structures.32,34,59
It should be noted that it is still diﬃcult to obtain a single Au−
Ag alloying species in each sample, as Au and Ag have a similar
atom size (i.e., Au: 1.44 Å and Ag: 1.45 Å) and the Au−Ag
bond has an ionic nature.37 Therefore, due to the conﬁgurational disorder, the experimental optical absorption spectra are
expected to be a Boltzmann average of the spectra of several
NC species.55 Increasing the Ag doping of the NCs (from top
to bottom in Figure 1b), the Ag heteroatoms can increase the
energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO),
while the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO) remains the same, leading to a larger HUMO−
LUMO gap (e.g., a blue shift of the peak at ∼670 nm).33,52,59
In addition, continuous Ag doping can also break the
symmetry of the superatom orbitals, resulting in a broader
spectrum.52,59 Taken together, the transition of UV−vis

example, there are three sets of peaks at m/z 1262, 1247, and
1232, which can be assigned to [Au25(MHA)18 − 5H]6−,
[Au24Ag1MHA18 − 5H]6−, and [Au23Ag2MHA18 − 5H]6−,
respectively (the following peaks are from the successive
coordination of [+ Na − H] of each species). In addition, we
also used dynamic light scattering (DLS) to conﬁrm that all of
the as-synthesized metal NCs were in the same ultrasmall size
range of 2−3 nm (Figure S10). As a result, we have
successfully built a library of full-spectrum water-soluble
AuxAg25−x(MHA)18 with a continuous Au/Ag ratio covering
all composition ranges, from Au25 NCs to Au-rich alloying,
medium-alloying, and Ag-rich alloying NCs, and ﬁnally to Ag25
NCs.
We further used the full-spectrum AuxAg25−x(MHA)18 NCs
to study their antimicrobial eﬀects on a model bacterium,
Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Interestingly,
we observed a U-shape antimicrobial trend for our samples. As
shown in Figure 2a,b, both Au25 and Ag25 showed the highest
antimicrobial ability of >98% killing eﬃciency.6 However, the
Au-rich NC side showed a decreasing antimicrobial ability,
while the Ag-rich NC side showed an increasing antimicrobial
ability. The transition point occurs at the medium-alloying
Au10−16Ag15−9-treated group, which showed the lowest
antimicrobial eﬃcacy of ∼26%. For the time-course antimicrobial test, we also observed a distinct diﬀerence between

high antimicrobial Au25 and Ag25 NCs and low antimicrobial
Au10−16Ag15−9 NCs (Figure S11), which suggests a low eﬃcacy
of the alloy NCs in killing the bacteria. Similarly, we also
observed the U-shape antimicrobial trend in Gram-negative
Escherichia coli (E. coli) (Figure S12), suggesting that this Ushape antimicrobial trend is valid for both Gram-positive and
Gram-negative bacteria. The U-shape trend in antimicrobial
capability of alloy NCs is diﬀerent from their common linear
trend of optical, electronic, and catalytic properties.50−52 To
quantify the antimicrobial eﬃcacy of NCs, we also measured
the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of each NC
sample (Figure 2c), which showed a similar trend that the IC50
of Au10−16Ag15−9 NCs is ∼4-fold of Au25 and Ag25 NCs. We
further determined the uptake of each NC sample inside the
bacteria, and no obvious diﬀerences were observed in these
samples (Figure S13). Therefore, a similar amount of NCs
were internalized inside the bacteria; however, these NCs
showed diﬀerent antimicrobial activity. The next question is
what makes the alloy NCs lose their antimicrobial ability
although they had also been uptaken by the bacteria?
Reactive oxygen species generation is a key consideration for
the toxic eﬀects of nanoparticles, as ROS can induce oxidative
stress and interfere the regular metabolism.60 As shown in
Figure 3a, similar as the U-shape antimicrobial ability (Figure
2), a U-shape ROS generation level was also observed. In

M25 contains an icosahedral M13 core protected by six pairs of
M2(SR)3 motifs, and the M(0)/M(I) ratio should be ∼1.53,54
The decreased M(0)/M(I) value suggests the appearance of
M(I)-complexes, which veriﬁes the decomposition of Au25 and
Ag25 NCs after the bacterial treatment, while the Au10−16Ag15−9
NCs kept stable during the bacterial treatment.
To better understand the decomposition process of metal
NCs, we can use ESI-MS to determine the decomposed
products of Au25 and Ag25 NCs (Figures S16 and S17),
leveraging on the atomically precise nature of metal NCs.
Detailed ESI-MS analysis of the samples can provide atomiclevel understandings of the antimicrobial mechanism of metal
NCs. The ESI-MS data suggest that Au25(MHA)18 NCs were
decomposed into Au(I) complexes and a mixture of Au NCs
with less valence electrons, such as Au 20 (MHA) 16 ,
Au 2 3 (MHA) 1 7 , Au 2 4 (MHA) 1 8 , Au 2 5 (MHA) 1 7 , and
Au25(MHA)19, while Ag25(MHA)18 NCs were completely
decomposed into Ag(I)-complexes. Therefore, the Au25 and
Ag25 NCs gradually lost electrons during the decomposition
process. A recent report suggests that AuNCs can interact with
oxygen (O2) when the NCs were exposed to air, and the
anionic Au25− would lose one electron to become Au250, while
the O2 can be activated by the electrons transferred from the
Au NCs to form superoxo and peroxo-like species.65−68
Therefore, we proposed that during the decomposition
process, the electrons from the Au25 and Ag25 NCs can
activate O2 to induce the drastic ROS generation inside the
bacteria, which can then interfere the normal metabolism to
induce the bacterial death (Figure 4i).69,70 To better prove that
O2 was involved in the decomposition process, we removed O2
from the Au25 and Ag25 sample solutions by bubbling nitrogen
(N2). In this case, no obvious decomposition was seen in Au25
and Ag25 NCs for more than 7 days (Figure 4j,k). On the
contrary, a rapid decomposition process was observed in Au25
and Ag25 NCs when a compressed air was bubbling inside the
samples (Figure S18). Therefore, we can conﬁrm that the Au25
and Ag25 NCs would be decomposed when they were exposed
to air and lost electrons to activate O2 in solution, generating
ROS to kill the bacteria. As for the alloy NCs with improved
stability, they are too stable to be decomposed and lose
electrons (Figure 4b), and the O2 could not be activated to
generate ROS, leading to a decreased antimicrobial ability. The
diminished antimicrobial ability of the alloy NCs is not
antagonistic to the improved antimicrobial ability of AuPt
nanoparticles, as the AuPt nanoparticles did not produce ROS,
instead they induced the membrane potential dissipation and
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level elevation to kill the
bacteria.49 Moreover, our results also suggest that the stability
of metal nanomaterials might also play a key role in their
intracellular or in vivo fate for biomedical applications.71,72

particular, the lowest antimicrobial medium-alloying
Au10−16Ag15−9 NCs only induced ∼1.2-fold of ROS generation
compared to the control group, while the highest antimicrobial
Au25 and Ag25 NCs showed the highest ROS generation ability
of >2.2-fold. These data suggest that the high antimicrobial
ability of Au25 and Ag25 NCs is attributed to their high ROS
generation ability.46,48,56 Similarly, we observed a similar ROS
generation trend in Gram-negative E. coli (Figure S14). Since
ROS is the byproduct of the intracellular redox metabolism,
the diﬀerent bacterial ROS productions can be caused by the
diﬀerent redox responses toward each NC sample introduced
into the system.61,62 As such, we investigated the eﬀects of the
highest ROS inducers (i.e., Au25 and Ag25) and the lowest ROS
inducer (i.e., Au10−16Ag15−9) on the intracellular oxidative
process. Three oxidative genes that are responsible for the
expression of metabolic enzymes to promote the oxidation
process were chosen to test the inﬂuence of NCs treatment on
the gene expression. The dmpI gene encodes 4-oxalocrotonate
tautomerase, which plays an important role in the oxidative
catabolism of toluene, o-xylene, 3-ethyltoluene, and 1,2,4trimethylbenzene into their intermediates in the citric acid
cycle, generating ROS as a byproduct.63 The narJ and narK
genes are mainly responsible for the respiratory nitrate
reductase, which can transfer electrons from NADH or
NADPH to nitrate, and the nitrate transport coupled to
nitrate reduction, respectively.64 As shown in Figure 3b, Au25
and Ag25 NCs induced a signiﬁcant up-regulation expression of
these oxidative reaction-related genes, while medium-alloying
Au10−16Ag15−9(MHA)18 NCs did not, which is in good
agreement with the ROS generation data. Moreover, to further
validate that ROS generation is the key factor in determining
the antimicrobial ability, we used an antioxidant, N-acetyl-Lcysteine (NAC), to bring down the intracellular ROS to the
basal level (Figure 3c).48 As shown in Figure 3d, the Au25 and
Ag25-treated group also showed a signiﬁcant decrease in
antimicrobial ability when the generated ROS have been
quenched by NAC. Therefore, we can conclude that the
decreasing antimicrobial ability of alloy NCs is caused by their
relatively poor ROS generation ability.
To understand why alloy AuAg NCs can induce a lower
ROS generation and lost their antimicrobial ability, we further
provided a detailed characterization of our NC samples after
the antimicrobial process. It is worth mentioning that alloying
might improve the stability of metal NCs in solution and in the
biological system.7,8,16 To ﬁnd this out, we measured the UV−
vis absorption and ESI mass spectra of each puriﬁed NC
sample and found that alloying indeed improved the stability of
the NCs (see the detailed spectra of each NC sample in Figure
4a−c and Figure S15 and the summary in Figure 4d). Notably,
Au10−16Ag15−9 was stable for more than 5 days without any
decomposition, while Au25 and Ag25 were decomposed after 3
and 2 days, respectively. In addition, we also collected the
bacterial samples after NCs treatment to measure the oxidation
state change of the internalized NCs by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS), which can also be used to reﬂect the
stability of NCs during the antimicrobial process. As shown in
Figure 4e−g, the Au25 and Ag25-treated groups showed obvious
oxidation state changes after the bacterial treatment, while the
changes in the Au10−16Ag15−9-treated group were not obvious.
The oxidation state change was proﬁled in Figure 4h, which
showed that the Au(0)/Au(I) ratio of Au25 changed from ∼1
to ∼0.7 and the Ag(0)/Ag(I) ratio of Ag25 changed from ∼1 to
0. According to the crystal structure of Au25 and Ag25 NCs, the

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we have established a library of full-spectrum
water-soluble AuxAg25−x(MHA)18 NCs by the integration of
two synthesis methods into one system. A U-shape
antimicrobial behavior was observed when the composition
of alloy NCs was extended to a full-spectrum range, where the
medium-alloying Au10−16Ag15−9 NCs only showed ∼25% of
antimicrobial eﬃcacy compared to their Au25 and Ag25
analogues. Detailed atomic-level characterizations (e.g., ESIMS) suggest that the alloy NCs are too stable to undergo a
decomposition process when they were exposed to air, while
Au25 and Ag25 NCs were decomposed to lose electrons to

NaBH4 solution (112 mM, 0.1 mL) was added to the solution, and
the Ag25 NCs were collected after 30 min of reaction. After synthesis,
PD-10 desalting columns (GE Healthcare UK Ltd.) containing 8.3
mL of SephadexTM G-25 medium with a molecular weight exclusion
limit of 5000 Da was used to purify Ag25 NCs in solution, with an
elution buﬀer of 10 mM NaOH solution.
AuxAg25−x(MHA)18 (x = 23−25, 19−22, 15−19). The synthesis of
alloy NCs followed a reported method.34 In a typical synthesis, an
aqueous solution of MHA (5 mM, 2 mL) was ﬁrst mixed with water
(2.35 mL), followed by adding a mixture (0.25 mL) of HAuCl4 (20
mM) and AgNO3 (20 mM) with diﬀerent feeding ratios of Au3+/Ag+
= 24/1, 18/7, and 14/11 under rigorous stirring, leading to the
formation of Au(I)/Ag(I)-MHA complexes. Then, NaOH aqueous
solution (1 M, 0.3 mL) was added to dissolve the complexes.
Afterward, the as-prepared fresh NaBH4 solution (112 mM, 0.1 mL)
was added to the solution, and the AuxAg25−x NCs were collected
after 3 h of reaction. After synthesis, a stirred ultraﬁltration cell
(Model 8010, Millipore Corporation, USA) with a semipermeable
membrane of 3000 Da MWCO was used to purify AuxAg25−x NCs in
solution.
AuxAg25−x(MHA)18 (x = 10−16, 5−11, 2−7, 1). In a typical
synthesis, the as-prepared Ag25 NCs were used as a seed. Then, Au(I)MHA complexes were prepared by mixing aqueous solutions of
HAuCl4 (40 mM, 0.5 mL) and MHA (10 mM, 4 mL), and the pH of
the solution was brought to 11 by using 1 M NaOH. Afterward,
Au(I)-MHA complexes solution was added into the puried Ag25 NCs
solution under stirring at room temperature, and the ratios of Au
atom to Ag25 NCs were 25:1, 12:1, 5:1, and 1:1, respectively
(determined by ICP-OES). The AuxAg25−x NCs can be collected after
1 h reaction. After synthesis, PD-10 desalting columns (GE
Healthcare UK Ltd.) containing 8.3 mL of SephadexTM G-25
medium with a molecular weight exclusion limit of 5000 Da were used
to purify AuxAg25−x NCs in solution.

activate O2, generating ROS to disturb the normal bacterial
metabolism and kill the bacteria. Moreover, the transition
point of the antimicrobial ability was only observed with our
full-spectrum alloy NCs, indicating the importance of a
complete understanding of the composition-related properties
and applications at a full-spectrum composition range. Our
ﬁnding is diﬀerent from the previous results where the alloy
nanomaterials usually showed enhanced performance in
application, suggesting the unexpected complexity of alloy
nanomaterials, which deserves further studies from multidisciplinary communities. In addition, due to the unique
atomically precise property of metal NCs, we are able to
understand the antimicrobial mechanism from the aspects of
the antimicrobial NCs at the molecular level (e.g., stability and
composition). This work also highlights the important role of
the stability of nanomaterials in biomedical applications,
indicating another key factor to consider for future design of
theranostic agents.

EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Materials. Ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ) was used throughout the
study. All glassware and magnetic stir bars were washed with aqua
regia, rinsed with abundant ethanol and ultrapure water, and dried in
an oven before use. All chemicals were commercially available and
used as received: gold(III) chloride trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O), 6mercaptohexanoic acid (MHA), sodium borohydride (NaBH4), 2′,7′dichloroﬂuorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), lysozyme, lysostaphin,
paraformaldehyde (PFA), N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), agar, and
synthesized oligonucleotides strands were purchased from SigmaAldrich; silver nitrate (AgNO3) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were
from Merck; Luria−Bertani (LB) was from Becton Dickinson;
Hoechst 33342, SYTOX Green nucleic acid stain, and ProLong
Gold antifade reagent with DAPI were purchased from Life
Technologies.
Instruments. UV−vis absorption spectra of the as-synthesized
metal NCs were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1800 photospectrometer. Electrospray ionization mass spectra (ESI-MS) were
acquired on a Bruker microTOF-Q system to determine the
molecular formula of the as-synthesized NCs and fragmentations.
The ζ potential and hydrodynamic diameter were measured on
Malvern DLS. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was used to determine the concentration of metal
atoms in solution, through iCAP 6000 Series, Thermo Scientiﬁc.
Optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of bacterial cells and ﬂuorescence
intensity of dyes were measured on microplate reader Biotek H4FM.
Bacterial ﬂuorescence images were taken with an epiﬂuorescence
microscope Leica DMI6000. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
was conducted on Kratos AXIS UltraDLD spectrometer.
Synthesis of NCs. Au25(MHA)18. The synthesis of Au25 NCs was
following a reported method.57 In a typical synthesis, freshly prepared
aqueous solutions of HAuCl4 (20 mM, 0.25 mL) and MHA (5 mM, 2
mL) were mixed in water (2.35 mL), leading to the formation of
Au(I)-MHA complexes under stirring conditions. Then, a NaOH
aqueous solution (1 M, 0.3 mL) was added to dissolve the complexes.
A freshly prepared NaBH4 solution (112 mM) was obtained by
dissolving 43 mg of NaBH4 in NaOH aqueous solution (0.2 M, 10
mL). Afterward, the NaBH4 solution (0.1 mL) was added to the
solution, and the Au25 NCs were collected after 3 h of reaction. After
synthesis, a stirred ultraﬁltration cell (Model 8010, Millipore
Corporation, USA) with a semipermeable membrane of 3000 Da
molecular weight cutoﬀ (MWCO) was used to purify Au25 NCs in
solution.
Ag25(MHA)18. The synthesis of Ag25 NCs was following a reported
method.58 In a typical synthesis, freshly prepared aqueous solutions of
AgNO3 (20 mM, 0.125 mL) and MHA (5 mM, 1 mL) were mixed in
water (3.775 mL), leading to the formation of Ag(I)-MHA complexes
under stirring conditions at 50 °C. Afterward, the as-prepared fresh
