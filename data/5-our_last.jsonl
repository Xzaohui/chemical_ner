{"id": 9135, "data": "title:graphdiyene enables ultrafine cu nanoparticles to selectively reduce co2 to c2+ products ; abstract:reducing the size of heterogeneous nanocatalysts is generally conducive to improving their atomic utilization and activities in various catalytic reactions. however, this strategy has proven less effective for cu-based electrocatalysts for the reduction of co2 to multicarbon (c2+) products, owing to the overly strong binding of intermediates on small-sized (< 15 nm) cu nanoparticles (nps). herein, by incorporating pyrenyl-graphdiyne (pyr-gdy), we successfully endowed ultrafine (similar to 2 nm) cu nps with a significantly elevated selectivity for co2-to-c2+ conversion. the pyr-gdy can not only help to relax the overly strong binding between adsorbed h* and co* intermediates on cu nps by tailoring the d-band center of the catalyst, but also stabilize the ultrafine cu nps through the high affinity between alkyne moieties and cu nps. the resulting pyr-gdy-cu composite catalyst gave a faradic efficiency (fe) for c2+ products up to 74%, significantly higher than those of support-free cu nps (c2+ fe, similar to 2%), carbon nanotube-supported cu nps (cnt-cu, c2+ fe, similar to 18%), graphene oxide-supported cu nps (go-cu, c2+ fe, similar to 8%), and other reported ultrafine cu nps. our results demonstrate the critical influence of graphdiyne on the selectivity of cu-catalyzed co2 electroreduction, and showcase the prospect for ultrafine cu nps catalysts to convert co2 into value-added c2+ products.
