However, efficient conversion of CO2 to produce fuels remains a challenge because a proper electrocatalyst is needed to make this CO2 reduction process more selective and efficient. In this study, we prepared nanostructured tungstate-derived copper to test its application in CO2 reduction. The prepared copper tungstate (CuWO4) nanomaterials were first characterized by analytical techniques such as transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to determine the particle size, crystallinity, purity, and composition. Then, the CuWO4 nanomaterials were further investigated in an aqueous solution containing 0.1 M NaOH by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) techniques. The CO2 electroreduction experiments were carried out in 0.1 M NaOH with the presence of CO2, and the analysis of electrochemical results shows that nanostructured CuWO4 performs better in comparison with CuO-a well-known electrocatalyst for reducing CO, to nongaseous carbon-containing products such as alcohols-because of poisoning effects of adsorbed CO, or its adsorbed-reduced intermediates on hydrogen evolution reaction. Our results also show that CO2-reduction intermediates adsorbed strongly on the surface of CuWO4, which increases the overpotential for hydrogen evolution reaction on the surface of CuWO 4 by as much as 230 mV against the 70 mV for CuO, at a current density of 0.8 mA cm(-2).\nDoi:10.1021_acs.jpcc.9b07133", "label": [[508, 523, "structure control"], [621, 626, "CuMOx"], [1304, 1306, "CO"]]}

Introducing a second element to tune the electronic state of Cu has been widely used as an effective method to improve catalytic performance, but achieving high selectivity and activity toward CH4 remains challenging.

Sulfur (S)-modified Cu electrodes were reported to selectively reduce CO2 into formic acid and fully quench the original CO2 production on clean Cu surfaces, yet the actual mechanism is still unsolved. To further understand this critical issue, herein, an integrated structure-selectivity investigation on the role of sulfur upon CO2 electroreduction was carried out. DFT calculations in combination with relevant experimental observations from the literature were utilized to identify the existing forms of sulfur and their impact of the reaction selectivity of CO2 to HCOOH under realistic conditions. Interestingly, most residual sulfur atoms were found to exist in relatively unstable forms during the reaction, which plays a dominant role in altering the reaction pathway by enhancing CO2 adsorption. In turn, these strongly adsorbed CO2 stabilize the unstable sulfur, and a synergetic effect between CO2 and S is proposed.

In the current study, the crystalline and valency factors that influence the CO2R activities of OD-Cu are revisited by employing single crystal Cu(111) foils that exclude convolutions from initial morphological and crystallographic heterogeneity. We observe that the overall CO2R performance, especially the C2H4 selectivity, correlates well with the initial oxidation level of the Cu(111) foil, of which the surface oxide layer is reduced into small fragments comprising rich grain boundaries and diversely orientated facets. Nonetheless, we find that the polycrystallinity and grain boundaries of OD-Cu, in this circumstance, are not the major causes of the observed activity enhancement. Instead, a transition state between the initial oxide and the finally reduced copper phases, as well as its longevity, dictates the catalytic property of OD-Cu in electrochemical CO2 reduction.

Herein, we, for the first time, achieve a high efficiency for electrochemical conversion of CO2 to C2H4 on a tin-modified CuO. By modifying with Sn, we obtained a related low onset potential of C2H4 as positive as -0.8 V versus RHE and a high Faradaic efficiency of C2H4 as high as 22% at -1.0 V (vs RHE). According to density functional calculation, the Sn dopant mainly enriched the electron density of CuO, while it was electron-poor in the Sn dopants. The rate of CO2 reduction can be enhanced on Cu nanosheets with higher electron density. We believed that this work would promote the development of two-dimensional catalysts for CO(2 )conversion and deepen the understanding of doping on CO2 reduction.\nDoi:10.1021_acsami.0c09240", "label": [[89, 93, "C2H4"], [620, 643, "Faradaic efficiency"], [36, 40, "CuOx"], [448, 464, "surface modification"]]}

In this work, we developed nanosized Cu2O catalysts using the hydrothermal method for electrochemical CO2 reduction to alcohols. Cu2O nanoparticles (NPs) of various morphologies that were enclosed with different crystal facets, named as Cu2O-c (cubic structure with (100) facets), Cu2O-o (octahedron structure with (111) facets), Cu2O-t (truncated octahedron structure with both (100) and (111) facets), and Cu2O-u (urchin-like structure with (100), (220), and (222) facets), were prepared by regulating the content of a polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) template. The electrochemical CO2 reduction performance of the different Cu2O NPs was evaluated in the CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 electrolyte. The as-synthesized Cu2O nanostructures were capable of reducing CO2 to produce alcohols including methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol. The alcohol selectivity of the different Cu2O NPs followed the order of Cu2O-t < Cu2O-u < Cu2O-c < Cu2O-o (with the total Faradaic efficiencies of alcohol products of 10.7, 25.0, 26.2, and 35.4%). The facet-dependent effects were associated with the varied concentrations of oxygen-vacancy defects, different energy barriers of CO2 reduction, and distinct Cu-O bond lengths over the different crystal facets. The desired Cu2O-o catalyst exhibited good reduction activity with the highest partial current density of 0.51 mA/cm(2) for alcohols. The Faradaic efficiencies of alcohol products were 4.9% for methanol, 17.9% for ethanol, and 12.6% for isopropanol. The good electrochemical CO2 reduction performance was also associated with the surface reconstruction of Cu2O, which endowed the catalyst with abundant Cu-0 and Cu+ sites for promoted CO2 activation and stabilized CO* adsorption for enhanced C-C coupling.

Herein, we demonstrate highly selective production of formate through CO2RR from a CO2-saturated aqueous bicarbonate solution using a porous In55Cu45 alloy as the electrocatalyst. This novel high-surface-area material was produced by means of an electrodeposition process utilizing the dynamic hydrogen bubble template approach. Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) of formate production (FEformate) never fell below 90% within a relatively broad potential window of approximately 400 mV, ranging from - 0.8 to -1.2 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). A maximum FEformate of 96.8%, corresponding to a partial current density of j(formate) = -8.9 mA cm(-2), was yielded at -1.0 V vs RHE. The experimental findings suggested a CO2RR mechanism involving stabilization of the HCOO* intermediate on the In55Cu45 alloy surface in combination with effective suppression of the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction. What makes this CO2RR alloy catalyst particularly valuable is its stability against degradation and chemical poisoning. An almost constant formate efficiency of similar to 94% was maintained in an extended 30 h electrolysis experiment, whereas pure In film catalysts (the reference benchmark system) showed a pronounced decrease in formate efficiency from 82% to 50% under similar experimental conditions. The identical location scanning electron microscopy approach was applied to demonstrate the structural stability of the applied In55Cu45 alloy foam catalysts at various length scales.

Tandem catalysis approaches are attractive for providing the product selectivity, which would be required for commercial applications. Here, we demonstrate a two-step tandem electrocatalytic E-CO2R with efficient conversion of the intermediate species. The catalyst scaffold is Si(100), which is etched to form a textured surface consisting of micron-sized pyramid structures with the {111} facets. Two metals are used in the electrocatalytic cascade: Ag is employed to perform a two-electron reduction of CO2 to the intermediate CO, and Cu performs conversion to more reduced products. Using high-angle physical vapor deposition, we form separated, micron-scale areas of the two electrocatalysts on opposite sides of the pyramids, with their relative surface coverages being tunable with the deposition angle. Compared to the textured scaffolds with blanket Ag and Cu used as controls, bimetallic pyramid tandem catalysts have higher current densities and much lower faradic efficiencies (FE) for CO. These effects are due to efficient conversion of the CO formed on Ag to more reduced products on Cu. Methane is the main product to be enhanced by the cascade pathway: a bimetallic catalyst with approximately equal coverages of Ag and Cu produces methane with a FE of 62% at -1.1 V-RHE, corresponding to a partial current density of 12.7 mA cm(-2).

Initially the synthesis of CuInS2 nanofibers was carried out by adaptable electrospinning technique. To reduce the imperfection in the crystalline fiber, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) was selected as template polymer. Afterward, the desired chemical structure of nanofibers was achieved through sulfurization process. Making continuous CuInS2 nanofibers on the cathode surface by the electrospinning method brings the advantages of being economical, environmentally safe, and versatile. The obtained nanofibers of well investigated size and diameter according to the SEM (scanning electron microscope) were used in electrochemical studies. An improvement of Faradaic efficiency was achieved with the catalytic active CuInS2 in nanofibrous structure as compared to the solution processed CuInS2. This underlines the important effect of the electrode fabrication on the catalytic performance. Being less contaminated as compared to solution processing, and having a well-defined composition and increased catalytically active area, the CuInS2 nanofiber electrodes prepared by the electrospinning technique show a 4 times higher Faradaic efficiency. Furthermore, in this study, attention was paid to the stability of the CuInS2 nanofiber electrodes.

The efficiency and composition of syngas production on the developed carbon-supported Cu/In2O3 catalysts are highly dependent on the In2O3 shell thickness (0.4-1.5 nm). As a result, a wide H-2/CO ratio (4/1 to 0.4/1) was achieved on the Cu/In2O3 catalysts by controlling the shell thickness and the applied potential (from -0.4 to -0.9 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode), with Faraday efficiency of syngas formation larger than 90%.

Although copper (Cu)-based catalysts produce hydrocarbons with relatively high selectivity during CO2 electroreduction, such catalysts evolve a certain amount of H-2 via proton reduction reactions. Because low-coordinated Cu sites are likely active for the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), hindering such low-coordinated Cu sites by decoration with inert metal atoms is a promising approach to increasing the selectivity of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) over the HER. In the present study, we synthesized tin (Sn)-modified Cu nanoparticles with varied Sn ratios via a simple wet-chemical method. Physical and theoretical characterizations revealed that Sn atoms preferentially locate at the low-coordinated sites when Sn is present at low contents (less than 1.5%). Compared with the bare Cu catalyst, the Sn-modified Cu electrocatalyst shows suppression of the HER and acceleration of the carbon monoxide (CO) evolution reaction. The first-principles calculations about the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates revealed that low-coordinated Cu sites with the modification of Sn atoms exhibited lower activity for both HER and CO2RR than that without modification. As a result, the activity of coordinatively saturated Cu atoms, where the CO2RR is more favorable than the HER, was emphasized.

It is not known whether heteroatoms act as a moiety of the catalyst or simply induce reconstruction of the catalyst. This work is an investigation of the role of the heteroatom in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction with a Cu electrode modified with methanethiol monolayers (MT-Cu), which is able to distinguish the presence of heteroatom contamination originating from electrolyte or air. Controlled potential electrolysis of CO2 using an MT-Cu electrode at -1.8 V at Ag/AgCl exhibits greater selectivity for C-2 products than an unmodified polycrystalline Cu electrode (bare Cu). On the other hand, a sulfur-modified Cu (S-Cu) electrode predominantly generates formate as a CO2 reduction product.

By combining electrochemical measurements with ex situ characterization techniques, such as XRD, STEM, elemental mapping, and XPS, we show that this behavior is caused by the segregation of copper and indium in these materials, resulting in the formation of a heterogeneous nanostructure of Cu-rich cores embedded within an In(OH)(3) shell-like matrix. The evolved catalysts show high electrocatalytic performance at moderate overpotential (i.e., j(CO) > 1.5 mA cm(-2) at -0.6 V vs RHE). We found that the removal of In(OH)(3) from these heterogeneous nanostructures decreases the performance of the evolved catalysts, particularly in terms of the selectivity toward CO, which then recovers with the reappearance of the hydroxide following the re-equilibration of the material. On the other hand, an In(OH)(3)-supported Cu catalyst exhibits a current efficiency for CO comparable to that of the evolved nanoalloys without the need for an equilibration stage, indicating that In(OH)(3) plays a crucial role in favoring the production of CO over Cu-In electrocatalysts.

We report here a systematic investigation of CO2 reduction on highly dense Cu nanowires, with the focus placed on understanding the surface structure effects on the formation of *CO (*denotes an adsorption site on the catalyst surface) and the evolution of gas-phase CO product (CO(g)) at low overpotentials (more positive than -0.5 V). Cu nanowires of distinct nanocrystalline and surface structures are studied comparatively to build up the structure property relationships, which are further interpreted by performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the reaction pathway on the various facets of Cu. A kinetic model reveals competition between CO(g) evolution and *CO poisoning depending on the electrode potential and surface structures.

Modification of electrodeposited copper foam with poly(acrylamide) leads to a significant enhancement in faradaic efficiency for ethylene from 13% (unmodified foam) to 26% at -0.96 V vs RHE, whereas methane yield is unaffected. Effects from crystalline phase distribution and copper oxide phases are ruled out as the source of enhancement through XPS and in situ XRD analysis. DFT calculations reveal that poly(acrylamide) adsorbs on the copper surface via the oxygen atom on the carbonyl groups and enhances ethylene formation by (i) charge donation to the copper surface that activates CO for dimerization, (ii) chemical stabilization of the CO dimer (a key intermediate for C-2 products) by hydrogen-bond interactions with the -NH2 group, and (iii) facilitating the adsorption of CO molecules near the polymer, increasing local surface coverage. Poly(acrylamide) with copper acts as a multipoint binding catalytic system where the interplay between activation and stabilization of intermediates results in enhanced selectivity toward ethylene formation. Modification with poly(acrylic acid) which has a similar structure to poly(acrylamide) also shows some enhancement in activity but is unstable, whereas poly(allylamine) completely suppresses CO2 reduction in favor of the hydrogen evolution reaction.\nDoi:10.1021_acscatal.7b04347", "label": [[6, 25, "surface modification"], [26, 33, "Cu"], [416, 425, "C2H4"], [455, 476, "Faradaic efficiency"]]}

Here, we demonstrate substitution of Cu with an isomorphic atom, i.e., Ni, in CuO and utilize it for improving the hydrocarbon selectivity by 4 times as compared to that of pristine CuO. Hydrocarbon formation is achieved at the lowest possible applied potential (-0.2 V, reversible hydrogen electrode).

Operando X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy measurements revealed that the alloying of Cu atoms with Zn atoms takes place under reaction conditions and plays a determining role in the product selectivity. Time -dependent XAFS analysis showed that the local structure and chemical environment around the Cu atoms continuously evolve during CO2RR for several hours. In particular, cationic Zn species initially present were found to get reduced as the reaction proceeded, leading to the formation of a CuZn alloy (brass). The evolution of the Cu-Zn interaction with time during CO2RR was found to be responsible for the change in the selectivity from CH4 over Cu-ZnO NPs to CO over CuZn alloy NPs. This study highlights the importance of having access to in depth information on the interplay between the different atomic species in bimetallic NP electrocatalysts under operando reaction conditions in order to understand and ultimately tune their reactivity.\nDoi:10.1021_jacs.9b10709", "label": [[85, 90, "Cu-M"], [507, 571, "structure control"], [747, 751, "CH4"]]}

Renewable methane produced using CO2 electroreduction attracts interest due to the established global distribution network; however, present-day efficiencies and activities remain below those required for practical application. Here we exploit the fact that the suppression of *CO dimerization and hydrogen evolution promotes methane selectivity: we reason that the introduction of Au in Cu favors *CO protonation vs. C-C coupling under low *CO coverage and weakens the *H adsorption energy of the surface, leading to a reduction in hydrogen evolution. We construct experimentally a suite of Au-Cu catalysts and control *CO availability by regulating CO2 concentration and reaction rate.

The obtained hollow Au-Cu NPs were then supported on carbon black for CO2RR measurement, and it exhibited a maximum CO FE of 53.3% at -0.7 V (vs. RHE), which was very close to that of Au NP/C, but the gold mass current density of hollow Au-Cu NP/C was much higher. The hollow Au-Cu NP/C also showed good stability in long-time measurements for CO2RR. To find out how the superior catalytic performance was achieved, hollow Au-Cu NP/C was then annealed in O-2 and N-2. It was found that after being annealed, the catalysts almost totally lost the activity towards CO2RR, which may be due to the partial segregation of Cu species on the nanoparticle surface as well as a decrease in the surface defect density with the improvement in crystallinity. Thus, it was concluded that high dispersion of more Au atoms on the nanoparticle surface together with the presence of more surface defect sites could account for the superior CO2RR performance of the as-synthesized hollow Au-Cu NP/C.\nDoi:10.1039_c8qi00297e", "label": [[25, 30, "Cu-M"], [106, 108, "CO"], [400, 426, "structure control"], [901, 927, "Faradaic efficiency"]]}

Recently, it has been demonstrated that alkali metal cations could greatly enhance selectivity for CO2 reduction by stabilizing the key intermediates, which leads to an effective solution to this problem by concentrating local metal cations through tailoring the catalyst structure. Herein, we synthesized spiky Cu@Sn nanocones over a macroporous Cu foam, which has a curvature radius of 10nm, via facile electrochemical coating of a thin layer of Sn over the Cu nanoconic surface. A faradaic efficiency of 90.4% toward formate production was achieved, with a current density of 57.7 mA cm(-2) at -1.1 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode, which far exceeds results achieved to date with state-of-the-art Sn catalysts. The performance should be attributed to the combined effects of a sharp conical feature that facilitates the enrichment of surface-adsorbed metal cations and the promotion of the mass transfer and active sites growth favored by the three-dimensional porous network.\nDoi:10.1039_c8ta06826g", "label": [[12, 17, "Cu-M"], [110, 117, "HCOOH"], [859, 864, "Faradaic efficiency"], [949, 991, "Faradaic efficiency"], [658, 679, "structure control"]]}

The nanocrystalline oxide derived copper (ODCu) electrodes are specifically attractive due to their high faradaic efficiency towards C2 hydrocarbons like ethylene, ethane, acetate and ethanol. However, the mechanistic understanding of this special selectivity is still an impediment. In this work, ODCu is obtained from Cu2O nanowires and employed for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, during which ethylene is found to be the major product with a faradaic efficiency of 65% at -0.8 V (vs. RHE). By in situ photoresponse measurement, combined with the ex situ structure and composition analysis, Cu2O is demonstrated to be persistent on the surface of ODCu throughout the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) even at high applied bias (-1.0 V vs. RHE), while Cu2O is not present on the bulk Cu foil. Density functional theory calculations are employed to further investigate the correlation between the surface Cu2O on ODCu and its C2 selectivity performance, which is attributed to the orbital interactions between the persistent oxide and CO2 reduction intermediates. It should be noted that uncovering the active sites is the initial step to understand the surface reaction chemistry in CO2RR; here, we propose that the presence of Cu2O is the key for C2 selectivity during CO2RR in the ODCu system, which may facilitate the development of highly efficient catalysts.\nDoi:10.1039_c9cp06009j", "label": [[620, 629, "C2H4"], [692, 715, "Faradaic efficiency"], [74, 94, "CuOx"], [817, 877, "structure control"]]}

This paper reports an impact factor for synergistic effects between Cu and nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) supports by comparing CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) performances on MOF-derived copper@nitrogen-doped carbon (Cu-NC) catalysts obtained by the calcination of N-containing benzimidazole-modified Cu-BTC (1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid) MOFs (BEN-Cu-BTC) at different temperatures. Different types of Cu-NC samples show the N species- and content-dependent catalysis for the highly selective electroreduction of CO2 to C-2 products. The characterization and experimental results indicate that the high contents of pyrrolic-N and Cu-N species formed at the annealing temperature of 400 degrees C can facilitate the C-2-product generation on a Cu surface, with the reaction rates and Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) for ethylene and ethanol being r(ethylene) = 5.38 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) (FE = 11.2%) and r(ethanol) = 8.83 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) (FE = 18.4%) at -1.01 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), respectively. However, excess graphitic-N and oxidized-N on the Cu surface result in considerable H-2 evolution and a rapid decrease in the CO2RR activity. These may occur due to the differences in the adsorption and valence state affecting the Cu-NC interactions. These results indicate that the catalytic activity on MOF-derived Cu-NC catalysts can be controlled by the N-type species that dominates at the corresponding annealing temperature, offering a new tack for designing highly selective complex catalysts since the electrocatalytic performance of the Cu-NC catalysts remains stable over 8 h.\nDoi:10.1039_c9cy01131e", "label": [[20, 59, "Cu/C"], [1147, 1158, "C2+"], [603, 813, "structure control"]]}

Herein, a series of hybrid catalysts consisting of Cu nanoparticles supported on N-doped porous carbon (Cu/NPC) were prepared. It was demonstrated that the selectivity for C2H5OH or C3H7OH could be tuned by introducing N-doped porous carbon materials as cocatalysts with different pyridinic N contents, which could in situ produce a reactive CO intermediate from CO2. By varying the pyridinic N content, highly selective production of multicarbon alcohols was achieved using the Cu/NPC hybrid catalysts with a high faradaic efficiency for one pot production of multicarbon alcohols up to 73.3% at -1.05 V (vs. RHE). The faradaic efficiency for C2H5OH and C3H7OH was 64.6% and 8.7%, respectively.

However, the low reaction rate and efficiency, as well as poor selectivity, have limited its further development. The low solubility of CO2 in an aqueous solution is one of the main factors that limit the reaction rate and selectivity of the electroreduction of CO2 (ERC) at a high overpotential. In this study, an organic additive containing an -NH2 group (methyl carbamate, MC) was incorporated into the ERC electrolyte for the first time. By utilizing the affinity interaction between a Lewis acid (the -NH3+ group formed by protonation of the -NH2 group) and a Lewis base (CO2), the ERC reaction rate was increased by 17%, and the faradaic efficiency for the production of CH4 reached 81.6%, which represented a large increase of 34% and surpassed that of most reported Cu electrodes. Furthermore, the partial current density for the production of CH4 was 31 mA cm(-2) at -2.13 V (vs. RHE), which represents an increase of 30% in comparison with that in the blank system. In addition, the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction was substantially inhibited, and the decline in faradaic efficiency increased from 38.5% to 48.1% when the potential decreased gradually from -1.63 V to -1.98 V (vs. RHE). DFT calculations further indicate that the -NH3+ group can significantly promote the adsorption of CO* and CHO* on the Cu surface and increase the surface coverage of both intermediates. CHO* can be further stabilized by the -NH3+ group via the facilitation of partial electron transfer from Cu to C and the formation of H-bonds, which is favorable for further hydrogenation to form hydrocarbons.

A dynamic hydrogen bubble template approach is applied to electrodeposit a binary PdCu alloy foam yielding a nominal bulk composition of 9 at% Pd and 91 at% Cu (denoted as Pd9Cu91). The material is further modified by means of thermal annealing (12 h at 200 degrees C in air), which completely transforms the as-prepared metallic Pd(9)Cu(91)alloy foam into its oxidic state. The ultimate catalyst activation is achieved by subsequent reduction (at -0.65 Vvs.RHE for 45 min) of the oxidic precursors (composite of Cu2O, CuO, and CuPdO3) into metallic state, as indicated byoperandoRaman spectroscopy. Identical location scanning electron microscopy (IL-SEM) analysis, carried out prior to and after the activation treatments, demonstrates significant morphological alterations of the Pd(9)Cu(91)foam on the nm length scale, which go along with a phase segregation into nm-range Pd-rich and Cu-rich domains that helps to increase the PrOH selectivity. Time-dependent ICP-MS analyses of the electrolyte solution, carried out during the catalyst activation, demonstrate preferential (rapid) Cu dissolution followed by (slow) Cu redeposition on the catalyst surface. These processes are found to be superimposed on the actual oxide reduction. A two-fold selectivity of PrOH was observed over ethanol (EtOH). The excellent long-term stability of the activated Pd(9)Cu(91)foam catalyst is rationalized by the full suppression of the C1 hydrocarbon (methane) pathway. The improved product selectivity towards the highly valuable C3 alcohol is rationalized by an efficient and concerted spillover of chemisorbed carbon monoxide (*CO) and atomic hydrogen (*H) species from the Pd-rich domains to the activated Cu-rich domains of the oxide-derived Pd(9)Cu(91)foam catalyst where the C-C coupling and subsequent hydrogenation processes take place to form the targeted oxygenate product.\nDoi:10.1039_d0gc01636e", "label": [[270, 280, "propanol"], [83, 87, "Cu-M"], [88, 94, "alloy"], [299, 387, "Faradaic efficiency"]]}

{"id": 4041, "data": "Title:Cu-Based Catalyst Derived from Nitrogen-Containing Metal Organic Frameworks for Electroreduction of CO2\nAbstract:With the development of human society and economy, the demand for energy resources has also increased rapidly. However, the use of traditional fossil energy leads to high amounts of carbon dioxide emissions, causing severe greenhouse effects. This, in turn, triggers a series of environmental problems. Harnessing renewable energy such as solar energy, wind energy, and hydropower to replace the traditional energy sources is very urgent. Conversion CO2 into value-added fuels and chemicals could be a useful strategy to mitigate the current energy and environmental crisis. It is well known that Cu-based materials are good electrocatalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (ECR-CO2). However, they suffer from some disadvantages such as high overpotential and poor selectivity and durability. Therefore, the development of copper based electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity is essential. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) materials that have the advantages of large specific surface area, tunable pore size and porosity, and highly dispersed unsaturated metal centers can be used as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction or as precursors for further preparation of catalysts with excellent performance. Through thermal decomposition in an inert atmosphere, metal ions in MOF can be transformed into metal clusters, metal oxides, or even metal mono-atoms. Meanwhile, organic ligands are carbonized into porous carbon materials. The addition of some heteroatoms such as B, N, P, and S to carbon materials has also been shown to be effective in changing the electron state and coordination structure of the catalysts. These heteroatoms combine with carbon atoms to form a new active site, denoted as M-X-C (M is the central metal ion and X is the mixed heteroatom) to enhance the catalytic activity of the ECR-CO2. Herein, pre-synthesized Cu-NBDC MOF (a Cu-based MOF synthesized by using 2-aminoterephthalic acid (NBDC) as ligand) is used as a precursor to anchor Cu2O/Cu on nitrogen doped porous carbon (Cu2O/Cu@NC) by annealing at different temperatures. XPS analysis shows that the Cu-N content in Cu2O/Cu@NC decreases with increasing annealing temperature. Investigation of the ECR-CO2 reveals that Cu2O/Cu@NC can inhibit the HER more effectively compared to Cu2O/Cu@C, thereby improving the overall catalytic activity and multi-electron product selectivity of the ECR-CO2. While the Faradic efficiency of formate (FEformate) increases with increasing temperature, those of ethylene and methane (FEC2H4 and FECH4, respectively) decreases with increasing temperature. Specifically, upon annealing at 400 degrees C, the CO2 Faradic efficiency of Cu2O/Cu@NC-400 is higher than 86% (-1.4 to -1.6 V vs. RHE), including 20.4% of FEC2H4 (-1.4 V vs. RHE) and 23.9% of FECH4 (-1.6 V vs. RHE). By contrast, FECH4 (-1.6 V vs. RHE) in the presence of Cu2O/Cu@C-400 without nitrogen doping is only 2.33%, and no C2H4 is detected. These significant differences in the catalytic behavior can be attributed to the fact that Cu-N is conducive for the stable adsorption of the *CH2 intermediate during the ECR-CO2, inhibiting the evolution of H-2. These results indicate that the pathway of the ECR-CO2 and its performance can be effectivel regulated by complexing nitrogen with Cu motifs.\nDoi:10.3866_PKU.WHXB202006017", "label": [[2545, 2553, "HCOOH"], [2092, 2138, "structure control"], [2140, 2150, "Cu/C"]]}

Several approaches including the fabrication of oxide-derived structures, atomic surface control, and the Cu+/Cu interfaces have been primarily used to produce ethanol from CO2. Here, a combined structure with Cu+ and high-facets as electrocatalysts is constructed by creating high-facets of wrinkled Cu surrounded by Cu2O mesh patterns. Using chemical vapor deposition graphene growth procedures, the insufficiently grown graphene is used as an oxidation-masking material, and the high-facet wrinkled Cu is simultaneously generated during the graphene growth synthesis. The resulting electrocatalyst shows an ethanol selectivity of 43% at -0.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is one of the highest ethanol selectivity values reported thus far. This is attributed to the role of Cu+ in enhancing CO binding strength, and the high-facets, which favor C-C coupling and the ethanol pathway.

The initial oxidation state of the copper on the surface significantly influences the performance of the materials in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR).

By tuning the electrochemical parameters, either Cu oxide nanowires or nanoneedles were fabricated and then electrochemically reduced to the corresponding Cu nanomaterials. The Cu nanowires preferred the formation of C2H4, while the Cu nanoneedles favored the production of more CH4, rather than C2H4.

In this work, Cu nanoparticles (similar to 4 nm in diameter) embedded in N-doped carbon (Cu@NC) arrays were fabricated by thermal decomposition of copper tetracyanoquinodimethane (CuTCNQ) under N-2. Compared to polycrystalline copper electrodes, the Cu@NC arrays provide a significantly improved number of catalytically active sites. This resulted in a 0.7 V positive shift in onset potential, producing a catalytic current density an order magnitude larger at a potential of -2.7 V vs. Fc/Fc(+) (Fc = ferrocene) in dimethylformamide (DMF). By controlling the water content in the DMF solvent, the CO2 reduction product distribution can be tuned. Under optimal conditions (0.5 vol% water), 64% HCOO-, 20% CO, and 13% H-2 were obtained. The Cu@NC arrays exhibited excellent catalytic stability with only a 0.5% decrease in the steady-state catalytic current during 6 h of electrolysis.

However, during the electrochemical reaction, Cu catalysts inevitably undergo surface reconstruction whose impact on CO2 conversion performance remains contentious. Here we report that polycrystalline Cu nanoparticles (denoted as Cu-s) with rich high-index facets, derived from Cu2-xS through desulphurization and surface reconstruction, offer an excellent platform for investigating the role of surface reconstruction in electrocatalytic CO2 conversion. During the formation of Cu-s catalyst, the two stages of desulphurization and surface reconstruction can be clearly resolved by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and OH- adsorption characterizations, which are well correlated with the changes in electrocatalytic performance. It turns out that the high CO2 conversion performance, achieved by the Cu-s catalyst (Faradic efficiency of 68.6% and partial current density of 40.8 mA/cm(2) in H-cell toward C2H4 production), is attributed to the increased percentage of high-index facets in Cu-s during the surface reconstruction. Furthermore, the operando electrochemical Raman spectroscopy further reveals that the conversion of the CO2 into the C2H4 on Cu-s is intermediated by the production of *COCHO. Our findings manifest that the surface reconstruction is an effective method for tuning the reaction intermediate of the CO2 conversion toward high-value multicarbon (C2+) chemicals, and highlight the significance of in situ characterizations in enhancing the understanding of the surface structure and its role in electrocatalysis.\nDoi:10.1007_s12274-021-3532-7", "label": [[141, 146, "C2H4"], [529, 532, "Cu"], [1171, 1176, "Faradaic efficiency"], [569, 591, "structure control"]]}

Therefore, product selectivity can be modulated by altering the Cu-Sn crystal structure of the electrode. Using the Cu-Sn alloy electrodes, electrochemical reduction was performed at applied potentials ranging from - 0.69 to - 1.09 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).

This phenomenon mainly ascribes to the lack of effective geometry and electronic engineering of copper active center from an atomic level. Herein, highly exposed atomically dispersed Cu-N-x (x denotes Cu-N coordination number) sites anchored on 3D porous carbon matrix are successfully synthesized through facile one step thermal activation, and Cu-N-4 sites exhibit boosted activity and selectivity compared to its nearly inert Cu-N-3 counterparts. Aided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the edge-hosted Cu-N-4 moieties are revealed as key active sites for efficient CO generation via optimized local coordination environment and electronic properties, which strongly interact with *COOH intermediate and facilitate the desorption of *CO. As a result, Cu-N-4 catalyst achieves high CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of over 90% from - 0.6 to -1.1 V vs. RHE with a maximum value of 98%, surpassing the previously reported Cu SACs for CO2-to-CO conversion.

To this end, a composite of indium species on CuO (InOx@CuO) was facilely synthesized for CO2RR, and it is found that the selectivity of the target product could be accurately tuned through incorporating post-transition species with Cu-based materials; the desirable Faraday efficiencies of over 90%, with a maximum value of 97.8%, toward CO formation were achieved in a wide potential window from -0.3 to -0.7 V. Moreover, a high CO partial current density of 7.2 mA cm(-2) and a long-term stability of 50 h with negligible degradation were obtained over InOx@CuO. More importantly, CO starts to be observed at an ultralow potential of -0.196 V, further confirming the excellence of InOx@CuO for CO2RR toward CO formation. The results demonstrate that the achieved superiority derives from the essential In species on CuO, which not only introduces more active sites, but also better stabilizes the key intermediates, accelerates electron transfer and increases CO2 adsorption.\nDoi:10.1016_j.cej.2021.131654", "label": [[31, 34, "CO"], [397, 405, "Cu-MOx"], [671, 676, "Faradaic efficiency"], [536, 597, "structure control"]]}

The prepared derivative electrode (HE-Cu) exhibited higher Faradaic efficiency (FE, 56.0%) of electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) compared with that of pristine Cu foil (p-Cu, 32.3%) at an overpotential of -1.03 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). HE-Cu also exhibited lower onset potential of CO2R as well as inhibiting the H-2 evolution reaction. Electrochemical measurements revealed that HE-Cu exhibited higher CO2 adsorption (1.58-fold) and a larger electrochemical active surface area (1.24-fold) compared with p-Cu. Physicochemical characterization and Tafel analysis showed that stepped Cu (211) surfaces, (200) facets and Cu edge atoms on HE-Cu contributed significantly to the enhanced CO2R activity and/or HCOOH and/or C-2 product selectivity. The FEs of HCOOH and C-2 products for HE-Cu increased 1.57-fold and 10.6-fold at an overpotential of -1.19 V vs. RHE compared with p-Cu. Although CH4 was produced on p-Cu, its formation was totally suppressed on HE-Cu due to the increase of edge sites and (200) facets.

Herein, we proposed an interface-induced method to prepare Cu2O nanocubes with controllable morphology and size. Due to the imidazolyl groups connected to the surface of ionic liquid functionalized graphite sheets (ILGS), Cu2O nanocubes were induced to grow on ILGS to obtain Cu2O/ILGS composites, where the size of Cu2O can be controlled by adjusting the concentration of Cu2+.

Electrocatalytic reduction seems to be a very promising technology to help to reduce industrial CO2 emissions. The development of catalysts capable of activating the CO2 molecule is the main challenge of this technology. In this work a copper supported on carbon nanotubes (Cu/CNT) catalyst has been synthesized using supercritical fluid deposition (SFD) and assembled into a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) type cell to carry out the electrochemical reduction of CO2.

The CO2 reduction rate and the products distribution attained with the three catalysts have been analysed. CO has been the main reaction product attained with the Cu/CNT catalyst developed in this work, followed by small amounts of formic acid and methane. This can be considered the main difference observed in relation with Pt or Pb based catalysts that promote the production of formic acid as main reaction product.

Crystalline nanosheets of this compound that show a preferential [00I] facet orientation exhibit undiminished CO2 RR activity after 16 hours with full retention of crystal structure and surface chemical speciation and no detectable corrosion. In contrast to the range of products formed on Cu metal, CuO, and Cu2O, the CO2RR on Cu3P [00I] produces mainly hydrogen and formate as the sole carbon product in KHCO3 electrolyte. Analysis of the Cu3P [00I] facet by HAADF-STEM was used to determine the surface lattice structure, while both XPS and Auger spectroscopies were used to determine the surface chemical speciation from the kinetic energies of ionized electrons. The presented analysis identifies isolated trigonal CuP3 sites on the Cu3P[00I]-Cu3P3 terminated surface and the Cu(I) oxidation state as precursor to the active catalyst. The CO2 RR selectivity to formate and the higher turnover rate for H-2 production on the [00I] facet allows a structure-activity analysis and chemical mechanism to be proposed. Formation of a surface hydride at isolated *H-CuP3 sites is proposed as the catalytic site in forming both H-2 and formate, while the long Cu-Cu separation retards forming C-C coupling products. These results disprove previously published claims of Cu(I) oxidation state as a sufficient criterion to promote CO2RR to C2+ products, show that stronger bonded hydrides, *H-CuP3 on Cu3P, favor production of the Cl product formate over all other carbon products, and predict that stronger formate binding (bidentate) is needed for CO2RR currents to compete with H-2 production.

The current barrier to this technique is the low efficiency of C-C coupling through dimerization of adsorbed *CO or coupling of *CO with its hydrogenated derivatives over the Cu catalyst. Tandem catalysts, which integrate Cu with another CO-generation catalyst (e.g., ZnO), can enhance the C-C coupling kinetics by increasing the local concentration of the key intermediate of CO. However, the degree of enhancement is strongly dependent on the spatial manipulation of supplementary CO transport. Herein, inspired by the reactant species concentration profile in a plug flow reactor, Cu/ZnO tandem electrodes are designed by spatially adding a ZnO catalyst layer on top of the Cu catalyst layer, in which the ZnO catalyst layer fed CO concentration progressively decreases over the Cu catalyst layer.

Compared to samples with slower cooling rates, the fast cooled CuO showed clear difference in their crystal domain sizes, micro-strain densities, and the chemisorption capacities of CO2 and CO. This micro-strain-rich CuO electrocatalyst exhibited a high total current density over 300 mA.cm(-2), and an outstanding Faradaic efficiency for C-2 products (with a majority to ethanol) at similar to 1.0 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. Our work suggests a facile approach of tuning grain boundaries and micro-strains inside Cu-based electrocatalysts to scale up electrochemical CO2 reduction for high value-added products.

The practical application for eCO(2)RR in aqueous solutions, however, still was encumbered by its high overpotential, low activity and poor selectivity due to CO2 mass transfer and intermediate stability. Electrocatalytic materials with reduced overpotential and high efficiency and selectivity are exploited for further development. Herein, Ag+ and Cu2+ precursors were co-reduced to generate Ag-Cu bimetallic aerogel after further freeze drying. Compared with Ag100 aerogel, the optimal Ag88Cu12 can effectively decrease overpotential, improve selectivity and current density, and keep electrochemical stability. At -0.89 V vs. RHE, the Faraday efficiency reached 89.40% and the CO partial current density of -5.86 mA cm(-2) was obtained. The intrinsic property of metal aerogel (hydrophobic, hierarchical porous structure, conductivity), presence of rich grain boundaries and geometric effect and the introduction of Cu leading to improvement of adsorption between the catalyst and the *COOH intermediate in Ag88Cu12, contribute to the enhanced performance.

In this work, we grew CuBi bimetallic catalysts on derived copper foam substrates by co-electrodeposition, and then investigated the correlation between co-electrodeposition potential and electrochemical performance in CO2-to-formate conversion.

This work furthers previous studies concerning the potential of carbonized copper MOF-derived electrocatalysts as catalyst materials for the electrochemical reduction of CO2. Two commercial copper-decorated metal organic frameworks (MOFs), HKUST-1 and PCN-62, pyrolyzed at variable temperatures, 400 - 800 degrees C, were coated on both metallic nickel and copper supports as inks. The electrocatalysts' potential to reduce CO2 was gauged using an electrochemical cell with both GC-TCD and GC-FID analyses. Many of the previously reported products of this reaction were formed, however, most notably, GC-FID analysis confirmed the formation of isopropanol, a product not previously reported to the best of our knowledge. It was observed that MOF-derived coatings can produce electrodes with both better current density and selectivity towards isopropanol compared to that of uncoated copper electrodes. Amongst all the carbon products observed, the best performing electrocatalyst demonstrated isopropanol faradaic efficiency (FE) of over 72 %.

Significant advances have already been achieved in understanding how some characteristics of copper electrodes, the current state-of-the-art catalyst for multi-carbon formation via CO2RR, affect the product spectrum. Advances and insights have been reported for, among others, the effect of crystallographic orientation, active surface area, and composition of M-copper (M = Au, Ag, Zn, etc.) materials, and how these alter the distribution of CO2RR products.

The Cu-CuxO/CNT/BC nanocomposite electrode was in-situ fabricated via reduction with the CNT/BC composite as a support, comparing KBH4 and NaBH4 as a reducing agent to obtain efficient electrodes for CO2 reduction (ECR-CO2). Both electrodes exhibited higher performance than the traditional carbon cloth or pristine BC supported Cu-based catalysts for conversion of ECR-CO2 to CO and C2H4. The CNT/BC as a support provided not only more active sites for copper catalyst but also increased the charge transfer and selective performance of C2H4 product, due to the synergistic effect of CNT and copper. The smaller honeycomb and dendritic lamellar crystal morphology of the obtained Cu-CuxO/CNT/BCNaBH4 electrode possessed a large electrochemical specific surface area, providing more active sites for ECR-CO2. The doublelayer capacitance and the current density reached 11.8 mF cm(-2) and 33.3 mA cm(-2), respectively. At a potential of -1.5 V-RHE, the Faraday efficiency (FECO + FEC2H4) was 66%. Moreover, the Cu-CuxO/CNT/BC nano-composite electrode was very stable, and withstood tolerance in ECR-CO2 for more than 20 h. This study possibly will provide a new design for catalyst support on CNT/BC substrate to regulate advanced catalysts/electrodes for different applications, especially to ECR-CO2 in terms of higher charge transport properties, lower contact resistance, higher current density, and more stable CO2 electroreduction performance.\nDoi:10.1016_j.seppur.2021.119832", "label": [[329, 357, "composite"], [29, 33, "CuOx"], [140, 142, "CO"]]}

Cu-based bimetallic catalysts are extremely promising for efficient CO2 reduction. In this work, we synthesize a series of porous bimetallic Cu-Sb alloys with different compositions for the catalytic reduction of CO2 to C2H4. It is demonstrated that the alloy catalysts are much more efficient than the pure Cu catalyst. The performance of the alloy catalysts depended strongly on the composition. Further, the alloy with a Cu:Sb ratio of 10:1 yielded the best results; it exhibited a high C2H4 Faradaic efficiency of 49.7% and a high current density of 28.5 mA cm(-2) at -1.19 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 0.1 M KCl solution. To the best of our knowledge, the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to C2H4 using Cu-Sb alloys as catalysts has not been reported.

To do so requires efficient, selective, and stable catalysts. In this study, we report a highly mesoporous metallic Cu catalyst prepared by electrochemical reduction of thermally nitrided Cu foil. Under aqueous saturated CO2 reduction conditions, the Cu3N-derived Cu electrocatalyst produces virtually no CH4, very little CO, and exhibits a faradaic efficiency of 68% in C2+ products (C2H4, C2H5OH, and C3H7OH) at a current density of similar to 18.5 mA cm(-2) and a cathode potential of -1.0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. Under these conditions, the catalyst produces more oxygenated products than hydrocarbons. We show that surface roughness is a good descriptor of catalytic performance. The roughest surface reached 98% CO utilization efficiency for C-2, product formation from CO2 reduction and the ratio of oxygenated to hydrocarbon products correlates with the degree of surface roughness. These effects of surface roughness are attributed to the high population of undercoordinated sites as well as a high pH environment within the mesopores and adjacent to the surface of the catalyst.\nDoi:10.1021_acs.chemmater.0c00761", "label": [[85, 92, "Cu"], [680, 692, "C2+"], [673, 676, "Faradaic efficiency"], [949, 1012, "structure control"]]}

A comparison between cubic and spherical CuNCs reveals the impact of surface reconstruction on the viability of surface functionalization schemes.

The electrolyte used was aqueous 0.1 M KHCO3. Chronoamperometry, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, online gas chromatography, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were used to characterize the electrochemical system and products formed. Carbon dioxide reduction using a Cu2O-derived copper working electrode gave ethylene (C2H4) and ethanol as main C-2 products, with optimized faradic efficiencies (FE) of 32.1 and 16.4% at -1.0 V vs RHE. The active catalysts were similar to 500 nm-sized crystalline Cu-0 particles, which were formed via the reduction of the Cu2O precursor during the initial phase of the CO, reduction reaction. When palladium(II) chloride was added to the electrolyte, C2H6 formation could be achieved with a significant FE of 30.1% at the said potential. The production of C2H4 was, on the other hand, suppressed to a FE of 3.4%. The alternate use of Pd-0, PdO, or Pd-Al2O3 dopants did not afford the same conversion efficiency. Extensive mechanistic studies demonstrate that C2H4 was first produced from CO, reduction at the Cu-0 sites, followed by hydrogenation to C2H6 with the assistance of adsorbed PdClx. Interestingly, we discover that both Cu and PdClx sites are necessary for the efficient reduction of C2H4 to C2H6. The PdCl2 was \"consumed\" during the reaction, and a hypothesis for how it contributes to the reduction of CO, to ethane is proposed.\nDoi:10.1021_acs.jpcc.5b09144", "label": [[94, 101, "Cu"], [634, 638, "C2H4"], [66, 81, "structure control"]]}

The ability to control the surface structure of CO2RR nanocatalysts provides an opportunity to tune product selectivity. Bimetallic gold-copper catalysts have been identified as emerging electrocatalyst candidates, but Cu incorporation typically lowers product selectivity compared with pure Au. Here we show sustained CO selectivity and activity up to 49% Cu content in small (<2 nm), thiol-capped Au/Cu nanoparticles (NPs). Bimetallic NPs containing 49% Cu selectivity converted CO2 into CO with 100 +/- 6% CO Faradaic efficiency and average mass activity of similar to 500 mA/mg during a 12 h electrolysis experiment at -0.8 V vs RHE. Au/Cu NPs synthesized without thiol ligands selectively produced H-2, whereas larger (>10 nm), thermally dethiolated Au/Cu NPs produced a wider product distribution including H-2, CO, and C2H4. Density functional theory (DFT) modeling of CO2RR and H-2 evolution at realistic, thiol-capped Au/Cu NP structures indicated that copper thiol surface structures sustained CO selectivity by stabilizing key *CO intermediates while making *H binding less favorable. Calculations also predicted that removing a significant fraction of the thiol ligands would increase *CO binding strength such that desorption of CO product molecules could become the most thermodynamically challenging step. This result, coupled with increased *H stability on dethiolated nanoclusters, points to decreased CO2RR selectivity for small, ligand-free catalysts, which is in line with experimental observations from our group and others. Our results demonstrate that thiol-ligand surface structures can sustain the CO selectivity of bimetallic Au/Cu NPs and reduce precious metal requirements for CO2RR.\nDoi:10.1021_acs.jpcc.8b06234", "label": [[55, 58, "CO"], [81, 86, "Cu-M"], [774, 784, "Faradaic efficiency"], [61, 80, "surface modification"]]}

In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of the electrochemical CO2 reduction on an electrodeposited Cu3Sn alloy by experimental and theoretical analyses. The electrodeposited Cu3Sn alloy electrode showed selectivity for CO production at all the applied potentials, and HCOOH production increased with an increase in the applied potential. In particular, hydrocarbon generation was well suppressed on Cu3Sn(002). To understand this selectivity change in electrochemical CO, reduction, we conducted density functional theory calculations for the reaction on the Cu3Sn(002) surface. According to the theoretical analysis, the Cu sites in Cu3Sn(002) contributed more to the stabilization of H*, COOH*, and CO* as compared with the Sn sites. Furthermore, the results indicated that Cu3Sn(002) decreased the surface coverage of reaction intermediates such as H*, COOH*, and CO*. We believe that these effects promoted CO* desorption while suppressing H-2 generation, CO* protonation, and C C bond formation.
